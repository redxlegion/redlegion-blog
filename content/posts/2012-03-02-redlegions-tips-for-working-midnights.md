title: Redlegion's Tips for Working Midnights
---

I recently landed a job on third shift, and it's the fourth time in my lifetime
I've worked third shift. I've always hated third shift, but I've also come to
respect the diehards who do it year after year. It's tricky, and not always
easy. The sun is your enemy. Summer is also a pain. There are a great many
things that get in the way of sleeping all day after working all night. Here are
a few tips I've gathered along the way.

1. Naps  
Never underestimate the nap. There will be periods where you're not working
midnights, whether they be one day spans or longer. Adjusting to varying
schedules is only possible when you're able to take a good nap somewhere in
between.

2. Light  
When you're trying to sleep, sunlight can be a major annoyance. Double up your
curtains, buy heavy ones, tape them to the wall. There are curtains specifically
designed to block sunlight. I kid you not. It can also help to stuff towels or
other miscellaneous fabric beneath the door to keep sunlight from peeking under
your door via a crack. Avoid horizontal and vertical blinds, it's not possible
to completely block sunlight out with those.

3. Sound  
Summertime is the devil when you're working midnights. Lawnmowers, children
playing, dogs barking, and cars backfiring- These are all incredible annoyances
if you're a light sleeper. Noise happens a lot more during the day than it does
at night, so invest in earplugs. You'll be a much happier camper if you do this
one ahead of time.

4. Alarm, alarm, alarm  
Should tips one through three fail you in any way (which *will* happen, as
nothing is guaranteed), make sure you have an alarm clock or cell phone alarm
that can be set for multiple times. The best practice I've found is to set an
alarm for half an hour before I have to get up, that way I'm not having to jump
up the first time I hear an alarm. It makes me feel better to know I can still
close my eyes a little bit if needed. Your miles may vary with this one, so be
careful. Not everyone is the same, and this tip might bite some people in the
ass.

5. Time off  
The greatest advice I can give you is to not forget that you're working full
time midnights. There will be large blocks of your time cut off from friends and
family because everyone needs sleep, and you just happen to have an incredibly
awkward sleep / work schedule that isolates you from a large portion of
humanity. Don't try and switch to a regular sleep schedule for one or two days
off. There are times when you'll have to wake up in the middle of the day to do
something important, that's inevitable. Just remember tip number one and you'll
be okay.  

Well, that's pretty much all I have. I need to get my own ass in bed right now.
If anyone else has something good to add, go ahead and comment. Maybe these tips
suck, or are just too obvious. I don't know. A lot of it I had to pick up along
the way. Good luck.
