In the case of faithless electors, I think it's time we put together a list of names and addresses of the electoral college at present. They need to know they will be held accountible if they do not vote how we want them to. If anyone knows how to get this list, [drop me a line](mailto:redlegion@gmail.com) so I can post that sumbitch up here and help ensure that our democracy is preserved without some rich asshole stealing the election from us.

It's imperitive we act now on this.
