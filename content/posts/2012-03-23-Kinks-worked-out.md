title: Kinks Worked Out
---

It would seem I have the kinks worked out in my ``rsync`` setup. I guess I
herped before derping when setting permissions, not realizing that the only way
to get the binary to execute with a new login group added was to restart the
process. It's okay, I have a helmet to protect me from myself. It's padded and
has hexagons like a turtle shell. Hurrrrr.

Aside from that, though, things are going. I'm working still. Always good to
have net gain in funds week by week. My feet, arms, and come to think of it-
everything hurts. Sometimes it hurts in a gratifying way. Body parts such as my
feet, however, not so gratifying. More of a stinging, burning sensation.
Cramping also sucks. Back cramps, foot cramps, overall horrible cramping. I'll
survive. I'm not here to bitch, dammit. I'll cease this at once.

Moving on, I'm trying to think of neat things to research and blog about. Things
I can post links to support. I don't know, maybe someone should email me with
ideas. That's always helpful. In any case, I need to get to sleep. Working
midnights is Hell, dammit. I'll live, though. I'll live.
