title: Countdown to Disaster
---

My unemployment ran out this month. I'm flying solo, completely without any sort
of safety net. If I can't maintain some steady stream of income, it's game over.
I'll lose my car and pretty much my only means of doing anything of importance
at the moment. Luckily, I'm working at an industrial complex through a temp
agency, but I'm not so sure this is going to turn out to be a regular thing.
I've seen people who are in through a temp agency that have been there for four
months, and they're still temporary. I'm not sure if they just haven't applied
or what their situation is exactly. Either way, this temprary gig isn't looking
very promising.

I still apply everywhere and anywhere. I've been rejected by a lot of low-tier
retail establishments. I'd be surprised if McDonalds would hire me. Not because
of my character or my ability, but because *this state is dying*. Refer back to
my [unemployment]({{< ref 2012-02-14-Unemployment-Rates-by-State >}})
post for why Michigan will sit and rot for twenty years. No one cares about this
state like they do Nevada or California.

Surprisingly, I've encountered a lot of resistance to moving out of state,
mostly from friends and family. No matter who I apply to for a job, if they're
willing to employ me in decent working conditions, I'll give it a shot. Even if
I already have a tenuous position. However, when I get something comfortable and
secure, I don't intend to go anywhere.

Well, I'm going to go eat and do my pre-work rituals. I just thought I'd update
this damn blog like I said I would. Working seven days in a row is going to kill
me, but getting overtime is going to be an amazing change of pace compared to
the pocket change I've been getting.
