This is more of a ping than anything. Not that I really need to ping
anyone or anything. Figured I'd let you know I still breathe. I'm still
around, I'm still cooking up things to contribute, despite my complete
lack of available time in which to do it. I have kids, I have gainful
employment, and I have a significant other, so don't expect much in the
way of me contributing to this blog. Not that I've ever continually
contributed to this damn thing at any point- I've mostly excised bits of
my brain and shat them into text, all for you to analyze and use as needed.

Is it bad that my WinSXS folder has 22.7 GB of crap in it? That's bad.
Yeah. Time to clean that motherfucker up.

Bleh. Eventually I'm going to start blogging about IT related crap,
maybe even a few bits of math. For now I'll drop a list of good songs.
Check 'em out.
