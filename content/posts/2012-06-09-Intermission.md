We take time out of our regularly scheduled programming to denounce and detract
from all the bloggers out there who are using [Wordpress][1]. Get a [real
CMS][2]. It's not that hard, kids. If you have anything worth saying, you might
as well deliver your message properly, you lazy pieces of shit. No one cares
much about what you have to say when you're using the livejournal of the
blogging world.

Good job, kids. You've negated your message entirely via it's very own delivery
method.

_**EDIT:** Yes, I'm superior to you. I take the time to make an effort._
