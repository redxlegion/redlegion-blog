title: Manic Scramble
---

I don't really have anything *"World Important"* to blog about today. What is
important to me at the moment is securing any sort of employment at all that I
can continue owning and operating a vehicle and at least living a little close
to the lifestyle I've become accustomed to. I've been scrambling to apply to any
and every job opening within a thirty mile radius. If anyone out there has any
tips at all, [they're greatly appreciated](mailto:redlegion@gmail.com).

It kind of sucks that I'm in a tight spot at the moment and can't blog about
things I find interesting or am passionate about, because I'm literally too busy
applying to jobs to just sit down and research something for a quick write-up.
Well, I'm probably nearing a 500 character limit I've imposed on myself, due to
time constraint.

Don't worry too much, though. Your least favorite blogger will come back with
rants and raves just as soon as he's supplied with a steady stream of income, or
is found face-down in a gutter somewhere near the equator. I'll leave the
decision up to you.
