Holy shit, it's been a while. Things have changed. Soooo many things. My job has
changed since I really took blogging even remotely seriously. I think the
trajectory of my career has been surprisingly upward. Moreso than I ever
considered it could go. It's a great thing, but it also taxes my ability to do
any *serious blogging*. I also have been so entirely out of the scene that I
pretty much don't keep in touch with anyone anymore, save for one or two
individuals.  

Man, I can't even. I just can't even.  

So I might post up a few useful tidbits I've collected over my brief
"non-blogging" period. `Brief`. Hah.  

One of these days I really need to put something up here that's not just more
"languishing death knell".  

F'reals. I will, too. Just you watch. I bet I'll have a half decent post up here
by 2025. Easy.
