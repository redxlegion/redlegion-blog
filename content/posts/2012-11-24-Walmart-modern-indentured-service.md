Surprisingly, I've had people defend Walmart's business ethics and
tactics in regular conversation before. I've heard people brush off
egregious wrongs against society as being "the norm" or "acceptable, or
even necessary business practice". I'm here to tell you; those people
are assholes.

[Walmart destroys the working class][wages]. This is undeniable. Those
who are forced into an employer/employee relationship with Walmart
(usually due to a serious lack of options, as Walmart destroys small
businesses), are always on the suffering end. Walmart profits greatly
from employing people they have no intention of giving raises,
insurance, or potential for advancement. What is also interesting, but
not surprising, is that many female Walmart employees are beginning to
discover that their male counterparts are making more money doing the 
same jobs that they are.

[Walmart doesn't give a rat's ass about you, me, or society][assholes].
This one, to me, seems like a no brainer. All of the community garbage
you see posted on the walls of each Walmart store is essentially a
shield. It's public relations nonsense to keep people shopping, despite
the incredibly poor working conditions suffered by those who are unable
to obtain gainful employment. Walmart, from highest tiers of management,
to the lowest of low, knows the score. Everyone knows the drudges of
Walmart are mistreated and expendable. It's common knowledge at this
point. How else can they operate so many large stores with the lowest
cost of overheard since the laying of the [Pacific Railroad][pac]?

I don't know. I doubt any negative press will change how Walmart does
business. If anything, it will simply remind people that Walmart exists
(should they forget), and that there will always be a place they can
obtain what they desire for a low price. It's pathetic, but it's human
nature. It can only get worse when people defend it. When people become
complacent. When they are no longer outraged to any extent.
