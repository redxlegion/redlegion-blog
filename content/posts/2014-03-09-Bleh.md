Finally bought a Moleskine to continue recording thoughts and feelings
in. Journaling is pretty important. Whether you're known to be insane or
are a stable human being, it's important to record things. What we say
for future generations to consume is both important and ephemeral. I
believe we can impact decisions made tomorrow with what we feel today.

In any case, I'm going to take a more active role in vomiting profusely
into the ether what I feel the ether is missing. I'm going to write more
about things that happen in my daily life and about things in which I
find a great deal of passion for.

Well, it's really goddamn late. I'm going to pay dearly for not paying
better attention to what time I go to sleep. It's not really of any
consequence, I guess. I don't have anything important going on tomorrow.
It's just going to be a horrible day from start to finish, what with my
complete lack of restful sleep.

Later, intarbutts. Don't have too much fun without me.
