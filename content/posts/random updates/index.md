Well, it looks like I'm going to try and maintain this blog as a Gatsby 'thing'. I'm probably biting off more than I can chew, but at least at the same time I'll be flexing some abilities in Typescript, JS, and a few other technologies more involved than just fucking Markdown. I love the convenience of Markdown, but it's mostly convenient because it only takes two brain cells to use. That works well for me, but I'd still like something a little more capable of some heavy lifting. Not sure why, I'm just feeling like a masochist I guess.

Finally finished my deck. I guess I'll post pictures here once I figure out how to post pictures here, LOL. Don't get angry, I'm just not there yet.

Man, node/js is a special sort of hell. I can't believe this trash is so popular. It's wildly insane to me that this shameful trashpile of a language is so fucking dominant. I guess it shouldn't be insane to me, humans are kind of a trashpile of a species. It would make sense that JS would be a frontrunner to a bunch of vapid monkeys that can barely tell their ass from a hole in the ground.
