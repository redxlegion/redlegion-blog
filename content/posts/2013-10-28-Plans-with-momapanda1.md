Sometimes, even the best laid out plans fall apart. That said, there are
times when small notions to do something wind up becoming reality
before you know it. I never thought I'd be capable of caring about
someone again, or that I'd even want to. But here I am, writing sappy
stuff, because I have. I've found someone, had a child with someone, and
am working toward building a future with this person.

So here goes. My intention is to stay with my current employer and
pursue training in metrology. I'm going to learn how to use quality
systems that are the standard and learn future standards in order to
apply the principles of quality to manufacture. And my future wife
intends to pursue a healthcare career by route of nursing. We're going
to give our children the best possible futures that they could hope for
and pass on the best possible values that we can, because we love them.

Also, thanks for making my political/infosec blog into a sappy
livejournal, you douche. I love you most, and if this doesn't fucking
prove it you need to be beaten up.
