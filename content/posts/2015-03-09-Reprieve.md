Two days at a waterpark and one day at a casino. I've had ample
opportunity to recharge my batteries for the coming onslaught of
[potentially] bad or simply rough times ahead.

I'm finding myself having less and less time to devote to being a blog
writer and webmaster. I'm glad I've deigned to organize this blog in
such a manner that it's incredibly "hands off", especially since I can't
be the interactive type of Admin many web services require.

I'm toying with the idea of applying to Chrysler. I'm just not sure if I
should roll the dice on one of the big three automotive companies or if
I should stay in a more flexible manufacturing sphere that's likely to
not suffer as badly as one of the big three should another crisis occur.

Decisions, decisions. Once we've made them, there's no going back.

I guess I'll just wing it and see where life takes me. Seems to have
worked pretty well so far.
