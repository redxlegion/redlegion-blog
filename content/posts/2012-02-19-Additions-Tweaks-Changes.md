I might as well lay out what exactly this blog is running. It's actually just
ordinary lighttpd behind cloudflare, with jekyll handling content generation. I
also ripped off Google's own SWF-based mp3 player for streaming mp3's. I've
added a decent favicon and added @font-face to the jekyll theme I grabbed. I'm
really enjoying the Amazon EC2 + Cloudflare + Jekyll combination. I even have
jekyll installed on the EC2 instance serving these pages up, so content
generation is as dynamic as I'd like it to be without having to worry about
transferring many (if any) files. I enjoy this setup, and I can post blog
entries from pretty much anywhere, given my current SSH setup. I can even blog
from my phone if I really wanted to. Jekyll kicks ass. Amazon does as well.
Blogging has never been so easy.
