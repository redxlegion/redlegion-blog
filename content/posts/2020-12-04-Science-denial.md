Every single person who entertained the notion that:

- Coronavirus is a hoax
- Shutting down the economy was unnecessary
- "Everyone was going to get it anyways"
- Entire medical establishments were lying about the severity
- Deaths were misattributed or outright unrelated

You people are literally the cancer killing human society on a global scale. You should be ashamed of yourselves, but something tells me that shame isn't in your vocabulary. Disgusting.
