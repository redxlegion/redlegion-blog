Holy shit I've been busy lately. Haven't had a lot of time to catch up with you
fuckers. So how've you been? What's new? Everything good? Yeah, I don't fucking
know. Everything is crazy. It looks like we're exiting "pandemic" status and
starting a new era of "Coronavirus is here to stay". Plus we're about to see the
largest economic bubble explode, rendering everyone much poorer. Oh, and don't
forget Vladamir Putin annexing Ukraine and igniting world war three. Good times.
Good times, indeed. I dunno about you, but I've been distracting myself with
spending time with loved ones, beer, and copious amounts of weed.

My home setup has changed quite a bit recently as well. On top of the Mac Mini,
I've added a Macbook Pro with M1 Max. Damn decent piece of equipment, and really
threw me for a loop. I've never received a gift like that before, and I don't
think I will ever again. What exactly is a guy supposed to dream about when it's
plopped into his lap? This thing has kept me more than distracted, that's for
damn sure.

I still can't believe my love got me this laptop for Christmas.
