I think it's time we address the elephant in the room: Evangelical Christians are destroying the United States.

I'd like to share a quote. It goes as such:

> Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them.

I may have shared the above Barry Goldwater quote before, but I'd really like to touch on one very specific notion in the paragraph above that I don't feel I've expounded on at length yet. "They are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise". Our nation is a nation built on laws, and those laws were all formed by politicians across the social spectrum compromising to determine what is of import to citizens and businesses alike. The 'uncompromising' nature of Trumpers, specifically, is what makes their effect on government so deleterious. They are a social cancer, they're strangling the nation of resources and efficiency, and they must be stopped at all costs. We've won for 2020 and on, but we have to continue to keep these snakes out of government as much as possible.

Evangelicals themselves are just ordinary people, but the politicians that have pandered to them specifically are virtually terrorists. The ideals these individuals want to hold for themselves are of no consequence, but the ideals they want to force on the nation are an utter disaster and must be stopped. It's time to end the insanity.
