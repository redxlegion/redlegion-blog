This facebook thread made me giggle a little. I have as friends some really
hard pro-Bama people, and it's interesting to see what flits across my facebook
from day to day. I despise the Republican party for a lot of the reasons I
despise Obama. They're old-fashioned, backed entirely by greedy corporations,
and favor iron-fist control over the people when it comes to security- not just
at home but abroad as well. For reference, here are the links mentioned in the
thread:

You might be asking; what's the point of contradicting propaganda when you don't
support the other side? Because this election is lose/lose, I'm going to be a
detractor for all sides. Thankfully, Republicans don't really require a lot of
hate- they bash themselves with shortsighted world views and terrible opinions
on the economy. Obama, however, is also making himself an easy target. Things
like Bush-era security tactics and tacitly ignoring the masses on subjects like
copyright make Obama the worst "revolutionary" president ever. He's just a
Clinton, but black. This is groundbreaking, how? Please wake up, sheeple. Your
government has been hijacked by corporations and *you aren't doing anything
about it, just rolling around in your own shit.*
