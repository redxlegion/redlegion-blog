Man, I can't even get into it right now. Just can't. But I'm killing it. I'm
just making enormous strides in life at the moment, and I feel really optimistic
about the future. More than that, I feel like I can summon enough optimism to
pull up those around me who need it most. There have been some serious tragedies
and difficult times for people that I care about, and as much work and effort as
I've been able to put into my own life has given me the strength I need to do
for myself as well as lend to others who might need it.  

Life is good. I am loving everything about breathing, existing, living, doing,
being myself.  

At work, I'm finally able to really kick ass and take names. I'm moving up, I'm
striking out in unforeseen directions, I'm making myself known and I'm expanding
my skills and abilities.  

At home, I'm making new friends. I love every friend I have. They're all
awesome. I'm surrounding myself with amazing people, and I'll never give that up
again. I'm striving to give everyone a chance, and I'm not going to put time or
effort to anyone who can't put time or effort forward for me. But that also
doesn't mean that I won't be available when they do want to put the effort
forward. I'm not cutting people out anymore. That's done for good.  

But dammit I'm looking forward to checking out the DIA.
