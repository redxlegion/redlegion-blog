# Super Mario 64 Windows Edition #
Some crazy cats decided to reverse engineer and port Super Mario 64 to Windows and DirectX. So here it is. [Download it](/download/SMB64PCdx12.rar).

[VirusTotal Result](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6aca0bf380e62ec7ebe7c2b44597d9a5b0f29507ea59474acbdda285f7ada7b6/detection)

See the VirusTotal result to guarantee the download above is clean. It's pretty awesome, but you'll need to install Steam and run it through Steam in order to configure a controller. Personally I think the Switch Pro controller is the best bet for playing, but that's all a matter of opinion. Also, I'll be sure and let you know if Nintento tries to sue me to take it down. Fuckers. ðŸ˜‚
