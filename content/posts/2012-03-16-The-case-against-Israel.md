title: The Case Against Israel
---

This might get long-winded. Here we go.

First of all, I don't agree with the whole bullshit "You have to be an
anti-semite to not side with Israel" argument. If you're pulling that out of
your ass, you can go [die in a fire][1] right now. If you're of the open-minded
sort, please do read on.

The Jewish population in the Israel/Palestine area, before 1918, was roughly [10%
of the population of the entire area][2]. In that period, Jews suffered a great
deal at the hands of anti-semites. They began migrating to what was then called
Palestine. By the 50's, Israel (as it was called after the UN partition plan),
[housed 7% of the Jewish population][3].

First of all, the ADL wants you to believe nothing other than [everyone Jewish
is entitled to settle in Israel][4]. This, to me, is ultimate irony. People
speak now about the ousting of Native Americans from their land as being
brutish and evil. They like to think we've advanced so much that it could never
happen again. Yet those same assholes are the biggest proponents of Palestinians
being ousted from their homes. Yes, we've come such a long way that we've turned
greed into a religious debate. If you ask me, the obliteration of Palestine and
it's people, as well as the fight against Iran equates to nothing more than a
[show of power][5] and [grab at money][6]. I'm not saying Jewish people are
greedy, I'm saying everyone is greedy. It's time to face facts- there are no
good reasons to give long-time residents the boot.

When early settlers felt encroached upon by the British, they hid in the woods
and shot at the redcoats. Arabs now have rockets to send messages. A far cry
from the bombs Israel drops on them, though. So just soak in the picture above
for a moment. Think about what you'd feel if that were a white settler throwing
beer at a Native American.

To be honest, you're probably an asshat no matter what, and still would smile
while pissing on the grave of the Native American- or in this case, Native
Israeli. Oh well. I tried.

Maybe if you watch this and think **really hard** about it. I mean *real* hard.
Maybe, just maybe you'll get passed the bullshit and propaganda, enough to see
what's really been going on.
