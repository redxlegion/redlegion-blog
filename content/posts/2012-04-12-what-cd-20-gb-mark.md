title: What.CD 20 GB Mark
---

I no longer care to hear about your "issues" with bittorrent. I'm nearing the
20GB uploaded mark on [What.CD](http://what.cd/) with a 48 kbps upstream. If you
ask me, that's an accomplishment on it's own. So quit your bitching, there are
people who have it worse than you. I make do, dammit. I think I do rather well
with what I have.
