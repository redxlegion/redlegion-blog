I started ["The Boys"](https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK), and it's damned good. Highly recommend. It's even grimier than Watchmen, a good sight more believable as well. Check it out some time. Besides, Amazon knows how to spend ad dollars effectively.

Also, the fucking money quote: "So... You'll teach me to outrun cancer?" Holy fucking balls. ðŸ˜‚
