I'm almost restored to my former glory. Bought a cable modem, shot
some textual nonsense to Comcast in India, plugged everything in, and
now I have my updated router and modem. Everything is all set for $30
in services and $50 in extra hardware.

Not bad. The only task left to tackle is getting my FreeBSD machine
connected, upgraded, and ready to roll. I don't feel that my setup is
complete without remote access.

On a side note, for my home setup, I've noticed enormous performance
gains when switching from SFTP to FTPS. I'm sure credit goes fully to
weaker encryption. I'm not super concerned with it, I just don't want
to shit my personal business over the internet in plaintext.

Everything is connected. I'm back. It's kind of nice.
