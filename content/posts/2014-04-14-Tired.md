My personal life is calming down. I don't like confrontation. I hate
confrontation. I avoid it at all costs. Things are calm now. They've
tapered off. I don't want disagreements or drama or insanity touching my
life. I get enough insanity at work. I'm all too heavily relied on by my
employer, my family, my loves. They need me. No one needs me to feel
bad. No one needs me to have regrets. No one needs me to be criticized
for being myself. I need to live my life. I need to be there for my
babies.

I think peace is finally here. It's about damn time. Things have been
too tumultuous for too long.
