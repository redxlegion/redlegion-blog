We have a house picked out and it's now "pending". Once it's finished and has certificate of occupancy, we're moving in. It's going to be a beautiful, huge, awesome house. Four bedrooms, two and a half bath, all your regular rooms plus an extra "flex" room. It's perfect. The person I'm establishing my life with couldn't be more perfect for me. The deadline of moving out of my soggy apartment draws nigh. I couldn't be happier.
