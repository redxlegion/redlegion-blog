This keeps getting blasted everywhere, so I'll link it up.

I find it funny that [we've sent a thousand troops to Israel][1] in preparation
for raping Iran, and [Obama sent a whole of 100 troops to Uganda][2] to try and
depose this sick bastard. I guess Islamophobia is spreading like flu. It's sad,
because it gets in the way of addressing serious concerns like the video above.
It's far easier to scare people with nuclear armaments than it is to get them to
feel for other humans. At least, that's what I gather from this.
