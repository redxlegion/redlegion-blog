title: Upgrade Complete
---

After a brief downtime, I've re-provisioned (due to my incredibly
cheap VPS situation) and I'm back up and running with a much newer
instance and updated software. I'm also changing distros to experiment
with resource management on my incredibly small allocation.  

I'm sure it'll work out better than Fedora Core did. FC seems to be a
bit of a resource hog.  

I've been trying to shoehorn Rust onto my FreeBSD 10.2 x86 machine,
but it just isn't happening. I can't compile it. There are no
functional x86 packages (only x86\_64), and I'm pretty much giving up
on having remote access to a Rust compiler of my own. Oh well.  

In any case, I guess this is really all this update is going to have
in it. Lackluster, I know.  

Eventually I'm going to get an opportunity to write something
productive. Stay tuned, I guess.
