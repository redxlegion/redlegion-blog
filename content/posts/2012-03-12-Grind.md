It seems as if things are finally leveling off. We've got lunatics in the White
House [who want to carpet-bomb Iran][1], [take away our right to protest][2],
but at least [some corporations are wising up at least a little][3]. Still, we
have a long way to go. Obama is no sort of hope at all, even [incendiary
writing][4] has him pegged pretty well. It looks like we're working toward a
gigantic goal of "nothing". Everyone who has a job is working hard. Everyone
seems to be struggling towards this single direction. The sad part is that this
direction leads to nowhere. The Dems are going to ruin us. The Reps are going to
ruin us. Who will swoop in and save the US? No one. No one at all.

I guess you could say that I'm a pessemist, but I honestly feel like this is
simply a reality everyone is beginning to accept- so I shall do the same.
