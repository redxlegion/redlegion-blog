Statistical [**An**alysis **o**f
**Va**riance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anova). Using [standard
deviations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) six
times higher and six times lower than your target, determine whether
your process is "in control" or "out of control". Good stuff.

It's also part of the framework for determining the reproducibility and
repeatability of gaging. I've discovered that Minitab is one of the best
software suites for achieving what you need in calculating ANOVA for
your GR&R. It's a great deal faster than laying out your own Excel
spreadsheet, and it allows you to completely automate the process. Doing
capability studies, GR&R's, and X&#773;&R charts becomes a task that
requires seconds, rather than having to deal with irritating Excel
spreadsheets or plotting by hand. I've learned a ton about statistical
process control. I've also learned a ton about what works, and what
doesn't.

One of my initial failures (and subsequently, great successes), was
discovering that using ten pieces with too similar dimensions will wreak
havoc on your GR&R. You'll wind up with study variance of 40% or worse,
which will affect every other aspect of your results (unless you have a
huge amount of tolerance).

I think I'm going to write a tutorial on how to conduct a Gage
Repeatability & Reproducibility study. Hmm...
