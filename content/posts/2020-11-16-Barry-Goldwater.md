> “Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them.”

He fucking knew. Barry Goldwater had anticipated this bullshit, this absolute ridiculousness, since as late as 1994 and potentially earlier than that.
