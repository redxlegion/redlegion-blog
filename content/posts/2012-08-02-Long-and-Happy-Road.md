My baby has my bean in her belly. We're running through baby names. We have the
name picked out if it's a boy. We're just having a tough time with girl names,
should the baby be a girl. Lucy is a pretty name, but pairing it with a middle
name is harder than we thought it would be. Still, it's damned fun to go back
and forth on this.

I've never been so in love with anyone before. I've never been treated so
lovingly by another person. I've never had such a fulfilling love life before.
Things finally feel like they're supposed to be. Like I have a real family with
a strong bond with someone who really cares about me. I couldn't be happier.

However, she really needs to know that I love her most, and that I've never been
so in love with anyone before.
