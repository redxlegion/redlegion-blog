_**Press play and listen as you read.**_  

It looks as though we're going to have to [hunker down for two weeks][1] given
all the bullshit going on. Good ol' COVID-19 is [running rampant][2] across the
globe and scaring boomers into destroying the economy. It's also pretty likely
that we're all going to be [unemployed soon][3] due to this little pandemic. The
worst part of it has to be the [panic buying][4] that everyone's succumbing to.  

I'm no super-genius, but I'd say this isn't going to be the easiest thing that
we rebound from. As a matter of fact, this is quite likely going to catalyze the
next big recession we experience, if it hasn't already.  

Watch out, shit's about to get interesting.
