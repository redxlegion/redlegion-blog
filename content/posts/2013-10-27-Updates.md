title: Updates
---- 

Added / Updated general site links
- Reverted back to using rsync because I'm lazy
- Changed VPS providers because broke / lazy
- Merged all services to single VPS because broke
- Still no dedicated network access, working on it though
- Will be returning to intarbutts shortly to harangue the masses
- Going to return to blogging about whatever the fuck I want

I think that about covers it. Not changing the style or mechanism of
this blog, though. The architecture works in case I want to be really
mean and piss off script kids, they'll have no recourse but to baww.

Also, hilarious files linked to by doxbin are back. Lul.
