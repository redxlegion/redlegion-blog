title: Jekyll (Bootstrap) is for Everyone
---

If you've seen a good number of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
blogs and find yourself pretty jealous, there really aren't any excuses anymore.
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) literally removes all difficulty
from using Jekyll. It's basically a [layer over
Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html) that has built
in support for theming, post creation, and more. With Jekyll Bootstrap, you
really need to know very little of the command line. If you have a favorite
theme that's Jekyll based, chances are that user has made it available on the
internet via [Github](https://github.com/). Hurry up and check it out.
