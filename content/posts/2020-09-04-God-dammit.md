God dammit. Well, what's done is done, I guess. But I can tell you now I'm going to start policing myself for posting while doing dabs, because that was some bullshit. It was barely coherent, scattered, and ridiculous. I didn't reach the original intended point **at all** and the few points I did stretch to make were sloppily done at best. It was mostly just angry shouting. I can't stand that shit. I'm not going to remove it, though. I'll let it linger to remind me why I'm policing myself.

Anyways. I keep writing about how I'm going to post something technical in nature. I really need to get off my ass and do it already. So I will try this weekend. Just for the weirdos who peruse this thing, which honestly I don't get. I mean, the traffic could be 99% bots, because what little traffic I get isn't so vast that it's beyond reason. Just watch out for my potential technical post. Oh lawd, it's comin.

Also, who the hell are these people?
