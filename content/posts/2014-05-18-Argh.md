If you're in the automotive manufacture industry, you're pretty familiar
with re-certification. It's that time of year everyone panics and freaks
the fuck out about either surveillance or re-cert audits, works seven
days a week, ten hour days, and has a mild heart attack over every
misspelling or problematic procedure in the control documents for their
company.

What disturbs me is that I absolutely despise this process. I hate it,
yet no matter where I go I won't be able to avoid it. I need to get out
of the department that has to deal with that garbage. I need to get ietnto
engineering, production, some other department. It doesn't matter.
I can't put in these hours. It's too much. I have a family. I have a
life outside of work. It's effecting me in some rather deeply disturbing
ways. I don't sleep as much as I need to and every day feels like a
hallucination.

Oh well. I'm sure something will give. I'll either get the fuck out or
die trying.
