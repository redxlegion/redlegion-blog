I found out recently that Cygwin has been including WeeChat in their
packages, so I had to dive in. Found out two things. One, Cygwin has a
new interface they install; Mintty.exe is fucking awesome. Two, WeeChat
is just as awesome in Cygwin.

This is my current layout, which I'm sure will change multiple times.

I need to grab more cygwin packages. Fuck. Yes.
