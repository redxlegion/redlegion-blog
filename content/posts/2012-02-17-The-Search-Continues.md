title: The Search Continues
---

I've heard back from one or two employers, I'm pursuing all leads. Hopefully
something comes from all this effort, losing my car would really suck. In any
case, I'm going to do what I have to do to survive. It's just in my nature. It
helps a ton to vomit random thoughts, feelings, and ideas into the ether. Having
an outlet is important during times of stress. It allows you to regroup and
think critically after your batteries have recharged, rather than limping along
the entire time on "empty". In any case, thanks for reading my rapid-fire
garbage. I'll leave you with some good stuff. Listen to the song below.
