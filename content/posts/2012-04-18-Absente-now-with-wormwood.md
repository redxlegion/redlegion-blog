What do you think? Should I do it? If I do it, I'll write about it. Ought to be
a fun time, right? Maybe it's good for getting rid of headaches. I've been
having insane headaches lately. If it sucks, at least it was pretty cheap.

**UPDATE:** *I'm going to be saving this for another day, when I have cause to
celebrate rather than drown my issues.*
