I'm sure I'll catch some shit for this. Probably at least a little. I'm *not so
legally* using a font for my website to display code. It's [not the cheapest
font in the world][1], either. I certainly don't have permission to use it, and
anyone can look at the CSS in my blog and grab it. I don't really care, though.
That's an insane amount of money to charge for a font. It's a fucking FONT,
people. I realize you've put some effort into it's creation, but it's also not
perfect. It's not the best damn font I've ever seen, nor is it useful in 100% of
situations I've encountered.

In any case. That was my rant. Enjoy the new `font`. It's called `PragmataPro`,
and it's now **[FREE][2]**, via this website.

__*UPDATE*__: See my [open letter to PragmataPro's creator][3].
