I never understood before. Not until now, I didn’t. She always used the music.
It was the music that connected her. I didn’t understand until now. I don’t feel
sad. I don’t feel grief. I may feel these things in time, but now I feel a much
deeper sense of what the last eight years meant, and how it all got shaken the
way it did.  

I don’t know if I’ll ever be strong enough to be a partner for her. I have so
much work to do on myself. But I hope she’s alright. I hope that she’s finding
peace somehow, in some way that's healthy. I hope that she’s okay.  She’ll
always have that piece of me that I gave her. And I guess I’ll always have the
piece of her that she gave me. We can’t take those things from each other, not
with words or actions, but we’re forced to keep them somewhere in our lives.  

But she always told the story of her heart with music, and it wasn’t until she
left me that I understood. Even now I can't listen to what I love without
remembering her love, without remembering loving her. I can smile, though,
remembering all the good times. I can smile through the hard memories, as there
were many. But most importantly, even if my music reminds me of her forever, I
can move forward into the future knowing that everything will be okay. No matter
what happens, I will be okay.
