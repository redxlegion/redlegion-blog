title: Life isn't Passing Me By
---

Things are going really well. I have a *(temporary)* new job, zero time on my
hands, and a crapload to do. Nonetheless, it's easy to find the positive in my
life because I have a lot of amazing people who care about and support me. I'll
always be grateful to the people in my life who matter.

The new job may only be temporary, but I have high hopes that it will become a
permanent situation that I can count on for regular income- even if it isn't the
best of situations, any situation is better than zero income. I'm at least
proving to be pretty good at it. I just wish I didn't come home every day
smelling like carbon dust. It could always be worse. I could come home smelling
like fry oil.

Well, this is just meant to be a short and sweet update, because I don't want
you kids to think I've stopped caring about you. Have fun, everyone! Be positive
for a change.
