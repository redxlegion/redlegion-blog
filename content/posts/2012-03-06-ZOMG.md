I'm damned glad I've pulled away from a lot of what seems to be online drama
whoring and idiocy. "Trolling"- thrown around a lot as an excuse for being
butthurt and not having the coping skills to deal with it without throwing a fit
like a little girl. "Hackers" seem to have the sorest tits I've seen, not having
any social skills at all and pissing off people by the busload. It's ridiculous,
really. Do you actually think it's acceptable to piss everyone off just because
you're in a position to? Just sad, really. Living in a basement or garage and
having no flesh body to turn to, just pixels on a screen, thousands of miles
away. I guess I'd need medication, too, if that sad existence were mine.

Damned glad I'm not stupid enough to trust people who were stupid enough to
violate my trust in the first place. Makes life a lot easier. Watching bad
things happen to people ends up being funny and pathetic, rather than sad.
Online drama is special because it seems to be a game of "King of the Hill".
Sure, one person ends up on top eventually- it is, however, inevitable that
they're thrown down the hardest in the end. Guess it's hard to see it coming
when you're the one on top for the moment, but believe me... It'll come.
