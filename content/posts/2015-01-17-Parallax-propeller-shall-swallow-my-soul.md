title: Parallax Propeller Shall Swallow my Soul
---

Technology is incredibly pervasive these days. I'm looking at getting
myself a [parallax propeller chip][1] to toy with soon. I don't want a
fully assembled kit, I'm looking at buying a 40-pin dip and a bread
board. The most expensive part will be the USB Prop. If anyone out there
has cool projects made in SPIN, shoot me an email. If I get into it soon
I plan on putting the code and photographs, as well as electronic
diagrams on my blog. I'm going to use [this guide][2] to start with. It
looks like an excellent starting point that doesn't require more than an
eight dollar chip and a few bits and pieces I should already have.

I honestly think my very first project is going to be to attempt a
network-enabled lamp. Maybe using [the PowerSwitch Tail II][3].

I'm just not sure what the best way to go will be. I guess we'll see.

It's amazing what eight bucks will get you these days. I guess in terms
of ICs, that's actually expensive. Maybe not too pricey for the hobbyist.
