title: Piracetam > Day 5
---

I believe I'm on day five of Piracetam. So far, so good. It does seem to be
boosting things for me, but I might have to bump up my choline. I'm starting to
get headaches once in a while that appear related. Granted, they're very benign,
not lasting more than a few minutes at a time. I've had a horrible history with
headaches. I've been put on some serious chemicals solely because I've had
headaches that lasted several days at a time. Chemicals that can cause complete
anesthesia of the extremeties (which really fucking sucks, I might add).

In any case, I'm just throwing this up here because I've been busy as hell and
haven't had a moment to think about something interesting to add. In my mind, an
update is an update, no matter how pithy. It's better than just leaving this
space to rot.
