I'm being a slacker. Don't you judge me. I have my blog set up that I can update from anywhere, albeit tediously. Still cool, though. What isn't cool is having to rely on Pandora for music. Also, this fucking sinus infection is horrible. I have Fallout centaur embryos flying out of my face with every sneeze.  
I'm ready for bed.  
It looks like I'm headed for another boring week where things still haven't picked up to feel like actual work. Oh well. At least I'm gainfully employed.  
I miss my future wife every day. When did this turn into a "stream of consciousness" entry?  
Blah.
