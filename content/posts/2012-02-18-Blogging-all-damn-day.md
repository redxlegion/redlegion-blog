title: Blogging All Damn Day
---

Thanks to Cloudflare and Amazon, I can just sit back and blog all damn day when
I have nothing better to do. This is fairly entertaining. It keeps me busy,
keeps my mind occupied. If I find myself frustrated, annoyed, or excited, I can
express as much to a whole readership of ten people! Hooray!

Seriously though, I've learned a ton in the past year. I've learned a lot about
FreeBSD, the internet, and the role the internet plays in the lives of people
who spend most of their time on it. It amazes me that long distance
communication can dominate lives over interpersonal interaction. I can't imagine
that. It seems like there would be a definite sincerity lacking to life if the
only way you could communicate with someone was via text, voice, or video. It
would have to be a motivator for suicide, at least in my perception. I can't
imagine living happily if you're completely alone, surrounding yourself with
online personas that don't naturally or accurately reflect the people behind
them. If you pass up genuine relationships for such things, you're missing out
not just on people, but life itself.

I've also learned a lot about the economy, and how hard life can be when it's
hard for everyone. Society, business, and government all come together to make
this clusterfuck we call civilization. When one lags behind, they all do. There
are no quick fixes for anything.

Well, I can't really think of anything else to rant about.
