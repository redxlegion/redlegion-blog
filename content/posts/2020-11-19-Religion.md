Using the bible to extract truth from existence is akin to rebuilding a corn cob from kernels found in a pile of feces. Using science to extract truth from existence is like rebuilding a corn cob from a corn field. Your choice here is highly indicative of who you are as a person.

All these idiots squawking about the COVID vaccine being "the mark of the beast" are clearly not educated on Revelations. You're just repeating shit you hear from others, you're not reading or investigating individually, and it pains me that you people exist.
