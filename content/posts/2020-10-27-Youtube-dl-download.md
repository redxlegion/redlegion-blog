Since the RIAA is getting Microsoft to delete the popular download utility [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) from Github and every fork that exists is also being removed, I figured I'd host it myself. They haven't stopped [hosting it](https://youtube-dl.org/latest/) themselves, but I figured they could use some vocal support. Fuck the RIAA, fuck Microsoft, and fuck Github.

Download it [from them](https://youtube-dl.org/latest/) or [from me](/download/youtube-dl-2020.09.20.tar.gz).

Fuck the RIAA.
