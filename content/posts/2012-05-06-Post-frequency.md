title: Post Frequency
---

Well, kids, it looks like it's time for a short hiatus. I can't really keep up
the post frequency of "every day" or even "every other day". It's going to wind
up being once a week at most, if even that. Things are getting too busy. I'm
caring less about shitting into the ether. Lots of reasons add up to one good
one- This blog is pretty pointless. Not to say it ever had a point to begin
with, but at least I wrote what I felt and it felt good to write. Now it mostly
boils down to a few douchebags "e-stalking" me and people casually clicking "x"
after parsing a few titles. I'll be honest, it's really not terribly impressive.
I don't write insane or fascinating viewpoints on current events or share crazy
new angles on programming or technology. At best I've shat some opinions out
there, same as everyone else, and pointed out one or two things I've found
interesting. Doesn't really justify the time or energy I've put into this thing
on the whole.

So this is basically a farewell to the *(fairly terrible)* post quality you've
seen so far, as it's going to reach new lows very quickly, albeit infrequently.

Here's a nice video for you to enjoy. Have fun.
