If anyone happens to know where I can find an oasis of jobs, just drop me a line
if possible. It appears that there really aren't a whole lot of options out
there. It's getting a little frustrating, seeing as how I have bills and shortly
will not have a means of paying them.

Anyway, any and all help available is greatly appreciated:
