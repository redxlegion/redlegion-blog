![Movement 2012](/img/2012/Day2.jpg)

Hey losers, you going? Have you even been to any sort of concert or festival?
No, the local Renaissance Festival doesn't count, you faggot.

Man, people accuse me of not having a life, and yet the only breaks they get
from IRC or twitter are 12 hour windows they fill with sleep. Infosec seems
filled to the brim with losers who bitch, gripe, "troll", and basically use the
infosec community as a vent to relieve the pressure of having no real life to
tend to. Congratulations, you have an e-girlfriend. Or some nasty bitch you used
to work with at 7-11. Or some husband who has no idea what you actually do
online (which really doesn't constitute much). I have a life outside the
internet, something you retards ought to "research" more.

So quit your relentless and useless bitching about "Anonymous" and "Occupy",
because no one gives a flying fuck about your opinions. No, cut your bitter
bullshit and go live life, and maybe you'll find yourself not having enough time
to bitch about inane topics no one really cares about.

Maybe, anyway... I somehow very much doubt it, though.
