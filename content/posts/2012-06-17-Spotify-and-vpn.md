title: Spotify and VPN
---

When I attempt to connect to my Spotify account after establishing a VPN
connection, it complains that my IP address doesn't match my country of origin
listed on my Spotify account. This is incredibly irritating. I shouldn't have to
choose between covering my ass and listening to music. The solution is easy,
though. Still slightly irritating, but completely functional.

1. Ensure VPN is off and you're connecting from your home IP.
2. Sign in to Spotify.
3. Establish your VPN connection.
4. &#63;???
5. PROFIT.

Pretty simple. When I took those steps it didn't even interrupt playback, but I
started getting Swedish advertisements. Handy trick. As far as I can tell, the
established connection retains all original functionality.

Enjoy.
