Total Palestinian children killed at the hands of Israeli police forces
between 2000-2014:  
_**1,397**_  

Total US children murdered in the same time span:  
_**7,437**_  

What the flying fuck, people? How is this acceptable in any way? Let's
look at more numbers, shall we?

![Palestinian territories pop](/img/2014/palestine-population.jpg)

4.44 million people. **0.03%** of the _ENTIRE_ population.

![US population](/img/2014/US-population.jpg)

319 million people. **0.002%** of the _ENTIRE_ population.

Do the children suffer due to the misdeeds of the parents? How is that
justifiable in any sense?

I have so many questions and not one of you Republitard fuckers has an
answer that makes sense. Shove your militaristic propaganda up your
asses. It's not wanted here.

**The likelihood of a Palestinian child dying at the hands of an Israeli
is fifteen times the likelihood your own child will be murdered- And you
live in a much larger country.**

_**EDIT**_: Had to re-check my facts. Got a few things wrong, but the
point is still valid.
