title: Scarcity

For the next five days, I'm going to be quite scarce. Even moreso than is
typical of me. I'm writing this as a stub. A placeholder to keep this rotten
corner of the Inter-ass warm whilst I'm away. I've been busy as hell. **Real
life&trade;** has kept me busier than most. Auto repairs, financial affairs,
rather typical and mundane things that a lot of slackers won't have to worry
about.

I'm continuing the Piracetam regimen. It seems as though adding Lecithin helped
make the headaches disappear. It also seems to boost the overall eficacy of
Piracetam as well. This little experiment will probably continue for some time,
and I may or may not devote more time in writing on it.

Seeing as how I have a tiny wedgie of a window in which to sleep, I'm going to
leave you punks now. Don't have too much of a party on the internet while I'm
away. It really isn't that big of a deal. Nonetheless, I'll be watching. I'm
always watching, whether I'm actively participating or not. Good luck watching
the watchers; it's the quiet ones you have to worry about.

Later, bitches.
