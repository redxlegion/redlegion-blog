title: At the Drive-in
---

It's going to rain soon. I can smell it. Summer is finally coming, and I have
some damned fond memories of summer. My last one was a mind-blower, that's for
sure. Certainly can't take summer for granted anymore. Too many fond memories,
too much to look forward to. The Drive-in used to be a cool thing I did, I guess
not many people really did it. These days, it has some significance to me. It
will be a place my mind goes, whether times are bad or times are good. That
place will always make me smile. I'm overly eager to visit again soon.

There are a ton of other summer activities I enjoy a lot, but that one takes the
cake, I think. Well, I'm going to leave you with a song I heard for the first
time recently. Not sure why, I just dig it.
