title: FreeBSD 9.0

I've been running FreeBSD 9.0 since it was released. Before that, I had been
running FreeBSD 8.2. Before that, 8.0 and 7.2 prior. I really enjoy this OS. I
think it comes from the enjoyment I got running Gentoo, however I learned most
of what I did about POSIX environments thanks to Gentoo breaking all the time.
It was definitely not an environment I could maintain. FreeBSD brings the Ports
software distribution system to a stable BSD kernel. It's my favorite operating
system, even if I happen to suck somewhat at securing it. I'm still learning,
and I'll continue to learn as I go. The best part, to me, is that pretty much
every problem you may encounter is almost readily solved with Google and log
watching.

Sorry, I was going to write a more informative post, but I'm just not into it
today.
