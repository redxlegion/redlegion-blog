I'm giving Bleep a try. It's the Bittorrent "Secure Communication App".

No idea as to how well these people can be trusted with secure
communication. It's an appealing idea; secure distributed communication
with no central point of failure. We'll see.

If anyone has any information on security or audits done, I'd be more
than happy to take a look.

For now, here's my Bleep contact info:
