title: Atheism is Neutral Ground
---

It's time to address a situation that has needed attention for many
years now. With our nation being a diverse melting pot of an immense
number and variety of loons, we're facing an ever-increasing amount of
tension. Most of this tension seems to emanate from religious factions
that maintain opposing belief systems.

If you were to drive around Dearborn, MI, you'd notice one thing; Your
white, Christian, pasty ass would be the minority. Dearborn is the
Islamic capital of the USA, just about. It has also been one of the most
scrutinized cities by the Department of Homeland Security in their
quest to profile and label every non-Christian in the USA.

As much as the US has been a melting pot, it has also housed malcontents
who believe their invisible friends are entirely superior to everyone
else's. I'll be honest- Every denomination of every faith that believes
they're "The One True Faith" is a hodge-podge of the most vile assholes
this planet has ever housed.

Examples:  

Intifada  

Christian Crusades  

Scientology  

Paganism/Wicca  

Goyim  

I don't think I need to throw in any more buzzwords for you to begin to
realize how shitty every one of those bastards really are. None of them
peaceable. None of them willing to cooperate with opposition ideologies
to benefit mankind.

They're all shitty hindrances on the progression of man.

One of the worst trends I've ever witnessed is the Christianization of
the United States. "In God we Trust", "Indivisible, before God", all
that is bullshit. Fuck God. Fuck all gods. Fuck everything that has
ever been achieved in their names.

I get blasphemous after one beer. Ha.
