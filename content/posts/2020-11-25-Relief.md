Things to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

- The people in our lives who make us feel things no one else can.
- The sigh of relief coming from D.C. with Biden taking office.
- A Coronavirus vaccine is on the way.
- Happy and healthy kids.
- The promise of open borders and traveling once the virus subsides.
- A future borne from hard work and maximum effort.

I think I could go on more, but I'll just leave this here for now.
