It appears as though the nihilists are winning as we delve deeper into quantum mechanics. [Local realism](https://phys.org/news/2017-07-probability-quantum-world-local-realism.html) is under attack from every front, it would seem. I honestly despise the fact that quantum mechanics are easy and cheap to dip your toes into. It's a short segue from [polarized light](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem/Introduction#Polarized_light_and_photons) to [breaking existence as we know it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox#The_paradox). Who wants a universe that both exists and doesn't exist until you observe that it either exists or doesn't exist? Yet you can perform simple experiments at home that lead you down this absolutely insane path. I don't know about you, but this shit bothers me. The underpinnings of everything in existence feel more solid than what we're teasing out from photons.

I wish I had some smooth way to wrap this up, but I don't have one.
