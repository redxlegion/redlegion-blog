I'm currently not sure what I should write about. I get that I'm writing this at
the moment, but I mean I do intend to write something substantial about
computing, programming, or maybe maths. I dunno. I'm still kinda figuring that
out. Until then I'm just doing the "one million monkeys sitting in front of one
million typewriters" thing.
