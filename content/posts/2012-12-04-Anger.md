title: Anger
---

I do think anger is a good thing to rid yourself of. It's not worth
carrying around. It drags you down. It weighs on your ability to see
that which is truly important. I let it run it's course, vile and pure
as it is, then I drop it as quickly as it comes. I leave it alone,
because those who wish to cause me to be angry really aren't worth being
angry with. I can overcome any obstacle thrown in my way. Creating
obstacles for others is far more time consuming than overcoming them.
For that reason I don't concern myself with such petty people and their
petty games. I actually have a life to live. I have a family. I have
people who love me. I have a wonderful baby boy on the way. My life
isn't callous and hollow, my life has meaning.

So, once again:
