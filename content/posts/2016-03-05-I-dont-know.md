Things seem to be heating up with Hillary. The ex-Clinton staffer who
set up her private email server was [granted
immunity](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/politics/hillary-clinton-email-server-justice-department/).
I don't think people are usually granted immunity to clear a person's
name or if she's *not* going to be prosecuted. I bet this is going to
be one of the most interesting elections we've seen in a while.  

I'm still voting Bernie. You should, too.  

I guess I'm officially a "career metrologist" now. I don't mind. I get
to tinker with scientific equipment. It passes the time, I'm good at
what I do, and I love being in a field that's constantly evolving
rapidly.  

My family is still amazing, I love them. I have the best kids in the
world, I have the best fiancee in the world. I can't complain.  

Life is busy. It's incredibly busy. I wish at times I could slow it
down, even if only for a moment, to better enjoy it.  

I guess I'll go sit down and learn some C.
