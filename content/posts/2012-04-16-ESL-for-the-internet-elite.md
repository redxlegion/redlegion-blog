The first issue I think that ought to be tackled would be confusing simple words
with one another. I don't understand it, but people seem to have completely lost
the ability to discern "you're" from "your" and "its" from "it's". "Their",
"there", and "they're" are also commonly abused. I'll break it down for you.

##It's and Its##

It's
: Conjunction. "It is".
: Use: "It's cold out." Or "It's stupid of you to fuck this sentence up."

Its
: Adjective. Belonging to or associated with a thing previously mentioned.
: "A faggot in its natural state will ignore this blog entry."

Alright. We good with these two? You kids understand these two yet? Yeah, we'll
see how much your tweets are impacted. I'm beginning to think I should just
drink before reading your tweets. Just saying.

##Your and You're##

You're
: Conjunction. "You are".
: Use: "You're a fucking retard if you wanted to put 'your' at the beginning of
this sentence."

Your
: Adjective. Belonging to or associated with the person the speaker is speaking
to.
: Use: "Your mom is a fat whore."

This one really should *never* happen. The only thing you need to do is think
about what you're saying. For instance, if you're a retard who constantly mixes
these two up- **DROP YOU'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR VOCABULARY ENTIRELY**.
Instead, always say "you are". Once you're comfortable with that, you can start
substituting "you are" for "you're". Congratulations, you're less of a retard
now. Simple tool for a simple mind.

##They're, their, and there##

There
: Adverb. In, at, or to that place or position.
: Pronoun. Used as a function word to introduce a sentence or clause.
: Use: "There is no reason you should be fucking up your native language this
bad."

They're
: Conjunction. "They are".
: Use: "They are going to ridicule your dumb ass relentlessly, as well they
should."

Their
: Adjective. Belonging to or associated with the thing previously mentioned.
: Use: "English is a language of the people. It's theirs to take. So take it,
fucktard, or quit speaking."

Do we have these three? I'm sorry, I don't have any neat little tricks to help
you remember these three, I kind of thought they were rather self explanatory.

##Summary##

There really are no good reasons to write English badly. There are no excuses,
even being born oxygen-deprived is an inadequate excuse. If you do these things,
you really have no business shitting words into the ether, and should an hero
promptly. So take this blog entry to heart, and practice writing, so that people
can actually take you seriously and enjoy speaking with you. I guarantee that if
you're constantly fucking these word conventions up, people cringe every time
you tweet.

**Addendum:** I can see the backlash already. No, people... I'm not claiming to
be the end-all be-all English teacher. I just have at least a fifth grade
understanding of our native language- something so many people seem to be
lacking. That's all this blog post is hoping to do; bring you luddites up to
speed. Kthxbai.
