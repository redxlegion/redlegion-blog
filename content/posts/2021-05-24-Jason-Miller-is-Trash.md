It looks like Jason Miller is [in the headlines again.](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-spox-must-pay-gizmodo-for-failed-defamation-lawsuit-2021-5) Apparently he didn't enjoy all the reporting done on that one time he banged a sex worker and then poisoned her with morning after pill. He was so a-n-g-e-r-y that he sued Gizmodo Media Group, who proceeded to pull all this really bad stuff out called "evidence" that totally didn't go how Miller expected it to. Apparently he now owes them $42k for trying to tell them to shut the hell up without any legal basis for doing so.
What a fucking moron.
Of course he's accustomed to wealth, it shows in how poorly he conducts himself. It's only a matter of time before he's caught with an eightball of coke and a thai ladyboy's dick up his ass.
