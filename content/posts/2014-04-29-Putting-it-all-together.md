Grab the [mention counter]({{< ref 2014-04-20-Ruby-twitter-mention-counter >}}). 
Grab the [tweet scraper]({{< ref 2014-02-15-Tweet-scraper-in-python >}}). 
Point it at four or five "known" associated targets and grab 3k tweets
at regular expected intervals. Better yet, use tweepy to regularly grab
tweets as they're sent. Amass a good amount. Once you've amassed a good
amount of tweets, fire up the mention counter. Make your cutoff large.
Make it count.

Fire up Gephi and open your CSV in it. It should automatically generate
an interesting map. Use the heat map feature to get even more
interesting results. Be amazed that you can OSINT. Most of all, have
fun.

By the way, if you'd like to grab Gephi, just [click
