I'm feeling pretty good right now. My arms and legs are sore, my abs are sore,
and my body feels like I've just run a marathon, but damn do I feel good. Been
taking these energy shots called "[Dynapep](http://www.dynapep.com/)". They seem
like they're pretty [bad for
you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylhexanamine), but boy do they get the job
done. They also seem to increase libido some, which is probably not good for the
survival of my genitals. In any case, though things look grim, I'm going to keep
an eye out for opportunity and stay positive. Sometimes that's all we have in
life- the ability to smile even though everything is tumbling down around you.
Of course, the Dynapep gives me enough of a rush that I don't so much care,
either. I'll just keep going on.

I'm a fan of "designer chemicals" and "better living through chemistry". I love
trading info like that with people and researching it, hence the Dynapep. If you
have more neat chemicals to tell me about, drop me a line at
<redlegion@gmail.com>. I tend to get bored, so I'll probably respond pretty
quick.

Also, I don't think I have yet explained in this post why so many of my muscles
are sore. Allow me to show you with a video:

I should probably thank the makers of Dynapep for making a product that gave me
enough energy to go for twelve hours. Good stuff.
