title: Things Moving Along
---

Things seem to be moving along. I'm working now, as you may already have noticed
from blog posts. I'm working midnights, though. Pretty terrible shift, I'm
hoping I can find something, whether at the same place or not, that's days.
Hopefully I can arrange something soon that will cease to destroy my ability to
sleep. Sorry for the lack of blog posts lately. I've been busy as hell. In the
very least, I have money in my pocket and a place to go every day. I'll be
grateful for the good things and wonderful people in my life. I'll make sure to
show them every chance I get, too. That said, I suppose I'll trail off with a
youtube video.

May it make hate to your soul once again.
