title: And so it Begins
---

Tonight is the first night I start working again in over a year. I really think
people have assumed I'm "on vacation". That perhaps I'm not exactly "looking
hard" for work or that I'm flat out not looking. The stark reality here is that
the jobs simply don't exist. It's hard to see that unless you're jobless and
struggling, in which case you probably aren't involving yourself with others all
that much and you're overly involved in your own search for gainful employment.
No, I've been looking hard for a long time now, not just for jobs that pay the
same rate I was making before- but anything. I applied to anything and
everything that came my way. Any employer that claimed to be hiring. Anywhere,
anyone, for anything- I applied and heard nothing back. I have more rejection
emails than I can count. Barack Obama is being lauded now for adding jobs to a
forlorn nation. The sad reality is that the jobs being added cannot sustain this
country. The government is despotic, I've realized that sooner rather than
later, and corporations are at the masthead.

It makes me sad to see people prod at the unemployed, the homeless, and the
suffering, like that's the life they've chosen. Yes, there are plenty of people
out there that have had mistakes. There are just as many people who've made
mistakes that aren't homeless or jobless. The reality is that unless you've
walked a day in their shoes, you're wholly unable to judge them- reserve your
words. Reserve your opinions. Opinions don't feed. Harsh judgement doesn't
clothe. Cruelty won't shelter. Unless you've actually suffered- you don't know
anything. Unless you've ever watched your child's heart break because you're
unable to meet their needs, you have no place to judge. So go back to your
armchair in silence. Continue doing what you've always done; measuring others
before measuring yourself. You have no place in reality.

Alright, I'm done with my rant.
