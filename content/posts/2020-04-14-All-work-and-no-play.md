I think sitting around all day and having nothing to do with the outdoors in any
capacity might be causing all of us some substantial mental harm. Though, the
alternative being putting those at-risk in danger may be a greater evil than
just sitting around all day. I don't know. I don't have all the answers.  

I do kind of want to just rip it off, like a band-aid. Just get back out there
and continue doing business as usual. It's starting to wear on me. It's making
me more bitter. I'm less tolerant of people who fail to think things through.
I'm less tolerant of people in general. I'm not doing awesome with staying
inside all day, every day. I need to find something to break my day up. I've
been taking a lot of vacation days to just decompress, but I don't think it's as
effective as I'd like it to be. Maybe I'll work more. Just get more done with
the tasks I have set before me. I dunno. You can tell I'm losing my mind when
working more is on the table.
