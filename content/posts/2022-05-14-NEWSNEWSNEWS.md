![Engaged](/img/2022/engaged.jpeg)  

_**We got engaged in Paris on the Ponte des Artes!**_  

I put a ring on it in Paris, and we had our engagement pictures taken _**IN
FRONT OF THE FREAKIN EIFFEL TOWER**_. It very nearly feels as though it was a
dream. It certainly wasn't a dream, there's a ring to prove it, and we're
planning to be married April of 2023. It's just wild to get on one knee and
propose to the woman who has made me feel loved for the first time, whom I love
more than I can describe with words. So instead of telling her with words I
tried to show her how much I love her by putting a "I'm taken" billboard on her
finger in the most romantic way I could think of. I proposed at the love lock
bridge we had visited only a year earlier.

I'm so incredibly excited. I've never been so sure of a decision like this in
all my life. Most of all, I can't wait to see what the years bring for us as
husband and wife.

Well, I have to go for now, but I do hope to try and update more regularly here.
We'll see, I guess.
