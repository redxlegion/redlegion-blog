Meh. "Trolling". Yeah. No, grow up. It's not trolling. It's only
offensive in how blatant and immature it is. Trolling is a art. This
isn't trolling, it's emo attention-whoring.

Oh well. Maybe if more kid's dads paid attention to them growing up we
wouldn't have so many irritating little shits running around begging for
attention.
