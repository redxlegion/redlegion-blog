Holy shit. Work work work. I feel like I've been living at work. It's a real
bitch, because I have a lot of people who are important to me that are suddenly
wagging behind this career. It's a real pain, to be honest. But I'll make time.
Everyone that's important to me deserves my time, even if I'm pressed for it.
That's something I can't let slip back again. I can't let people fall to the
wayside, because they've really been there for me through some of the hardest
shit I've had to go through. I won't give up on the people who didn't give up on
me, dammit.  

There was something I was going to say here. I don't remember, now, though.
