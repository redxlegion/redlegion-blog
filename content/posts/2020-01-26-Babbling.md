I'm so aloof right now. I just don't feel grounded in the slightest. I feel like
I'm all over the place, and I think that's about as accurate a description of me
that can be made. Tomorrow is poised to be very interesting. I think tomorrow is
quite likely the point in my life where things reach peak "shit-hit-the-fan"
levels. We'll see, I guess.  

I know I keep promising "interesting" content for this blog. I know I'm more
than capable of generating it. I just have other things going on in life that
honestly matter at least a little more than any of that shit. So I keep getting
caught in the excuse that I just don't fucking give a shit. It is what it is.  

I guess I can avoid totally wasting your time and tell you that there's a
youtube video out there where a guy programs "Hello World" on a 6502 CPU using
only resistors, and it's fucking badass. The guy who made it is named "Ben
Eater", and he's a fucking genius. Follow him.
