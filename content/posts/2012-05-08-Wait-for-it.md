Just saw a hilarious comment awaiting approval. This is pretty much the only
response that comment deserves, and it can just go ahead and languish. I'm not
affiliated with anyone, no groups or persons. Point in fact, I'm avoiding the
drama whores as if they carried Bubonic Plague.

Enjoy your derision and ridicule, it's all that I (and most of society) are
willing to offer.

I'm completely out of "the scene", as it were. No IRC presence, dumped
everything except this domain. So, sit back and enjoy [this critique of your
efforts on the whole](/img/lol.jpg). I'm done, now go away.
