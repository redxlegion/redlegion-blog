title: Pro/E - PTC Creo 3.0 Parametric
---

I have an educational copy of Pro/E (a.k.a. PTC Creo 3.0 Parametric). It
was easy to download. It was easy to activate. It's not all that easy to
use. I get some simple concepts and such, but I really need a decent
tutorial on advanced use, or at least practical application for
semi-complex geometry.

In short, I need help.

If anyone knows the best resource online for beginner tutorials, I'd
really appreciate it. Just [email me](mailto:redlegion@gmail.com). Or
get hold of me on the [about](/about) page of my blog. In any case, I'm
grateful for all help provided.
