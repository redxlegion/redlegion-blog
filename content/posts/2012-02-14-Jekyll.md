title: Jekyll

I've completely fallen in love with Jekyll as a blogging platform. I might
create a few more websites or write my own Jekyll template, depending on free
time and my mood in the next two weeks. If I'm able to find employment that
gives me a moment's peace, I'll definitely forge forward with the awesomeness
that is a Jekyll tutorial, because I think everyone should get to know this
stuff. It's fun, flexible, and worth investing a little time to research. I'll
drop a link to it in another post some time today.

Watch out for this blog to explode retardedly. Posting is altogether way too
easy with this thing.
