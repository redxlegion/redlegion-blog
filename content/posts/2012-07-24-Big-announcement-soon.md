title: Big Announcement Soon
---

I've been working seven days a week. On top of that, two computers do very well
to reverse the cooling effect offered by air conditioners, so I've had both
systems turned off nearly every day since my last update.

They're going to be left on, however, for the next fews days. I have a big
announcement to make, and I'm going to put pieces of the blog post together (ie.
pictures and the like) so that I can fully and formerly release this big news
that some of the readership here may already know.

Just a word of caution, however- Big news is big news. It's not something to be
an asshole about. If you have qualms or queries, you can direct them [to
me](mailto:redlegion@gmail.com) as necessary. Stupid shit need not be put in the
comments.

Thanks, and keep your eyes peeled. It's coming!
