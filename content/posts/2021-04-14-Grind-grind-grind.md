Glad I got the last post off my chest. Now it's nothing but looking onward and upward, and I get to do it with my best friend and the best partner ever. I think 2020 and most of 2021 has proven fairly awful for a lot of people, but I can honestly say that 2020 and on has been some of the best times in my life, even the difficult parts. Fifteen days left until keys get returned. Crazy.
