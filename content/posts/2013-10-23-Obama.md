It still amazes me these days that there are some out there who are
vehement proponents of Barack Obama. I can only attribute to these
people that denial is the strongest emotion they're capable of
mustering. Denial is the only thing a person can hold on to when faced
with the harsh reality that he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. I'm going
to gather a few points that blast solid democrats out of the water.

**Drone strikes**

Obama loves drone strikes. Women, children, the elderly- they're all
subject to the oppression of Obama and his unmanned bombers.

**Government transparency**

One of Obama's huge "Change" proposals he heralded was a new era of
government transparency, which would usher in an entirely new type of
government that is accountable and answers to it's constituents. Mhm.

BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! Apparently, there are a ton of asshole democrats
out there who support Obama and state that the media is just lashing out
unfairly! Sure. Sounds awesome. Except for [Obama saying that Manning
was guilty before he was even put on
trial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfmtUpd4id0). Yeah, a true
transparency advocate would grill any whistleblower. That's complete
media bias right there. Absolutely.

No. Fuck you all. You're all retarded sheep. You can be shown the world
in a million ways and you'll still only see it within the limited scope
of your pathetic views.

I'm disgusted.
