Not sure what this is. [@cloudflaresys](https://twitter.com/cloudflaresys)
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/CloudFlareSys/status/224396202857332738) about a
"small attack" about the same time this information was logged. Not sure if it
was explicitly directed at me or what. Still funny, though. Would be interesting
to see if they're able to dump raw logs.

In any case, thought it was a humorous anecdote.
