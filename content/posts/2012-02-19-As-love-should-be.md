title: As Love Should Be
---

It seems like time passes quickly. I can close my eyes in Winter and find myself
waking in Spring. Time is most certainly relative. As much as time passes and
things change, there will be things that never change. One example of a decent
universal constant; You can't be in a romantic relationship with someone who
isn't your best friend as well, unless you're simply not serious about it. It
makes sense when you think about it. A serious relationship will consist of
blatant honesty, trust, mental engagement, and a desire for the welfare of one
another and the relationship as a whole. Standing alongside one another,
catching each other if one falls. That's how it should be. I've finally found
it, the first wholly healthy relationship I've ever had. I've found intimacy and
common ground with an amazing human being, and I've never been happier about it.
This is what love should be. I hope to never lose it, and I'll never let it go.
