I've been toying around with Google Analytics, and I've found some pretty
interesting stuff. It actually flies beyond the border of creepy and flatly
allows you to "stalk your stalkers". They might as well coin the term
"counter-stalking", because they allow you to watch everyone who views your
website, their behavior, and you can even make web design decisions that are
quite sound based on what you find in the data and how you interpret it. After
nosing around a bit, I can tell you that if I really wanted my website to take
off I'd cease blogging rants about how Obama sucks or why we shouldn't interfere
in Israel's "issues" and instead just post five lolcats a day. That would be all
it takes to make this website Ã¼ber-popular. Just lolcats. Mind you, I'm not
going to do that. I'm going to do what I damn well please because I don't blog
to please others, I blog to please myself. So this crevice can remain solemnly
unpopular for all the fucks I give. But just check out how creepy this "user
interaction flow" is.

Creepy, right? Max of 12 interactions for the users who browsed the longest, and
those flows represent how they browsed the site. Each red "waterfall" represents
people clicking "x" and telling me to virtually fuck off.

I am, however, considering replacing the whole blog with a copy of Encyclopedia
Dramatica's "Offended" page. I might add that, actually... Hmm...
