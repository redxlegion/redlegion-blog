I've installed Photoshop CS6 and I'm getting creative again. It feels good to
let images from my brain flow into pixels on a screen. Just one image so far. I
haven't had much free time.

The model is my beautiful girlfriend. The nice thing about manipulating photos
of her is that even if the changes I make are stupid or horrendous, at least
she's beautiful enough to take your attention away from the junk I add or
change.

Definitely going to work on more.
