title: Free Website Stress Tests!

Apparently I was *afk* for "Free Website Stress Test Day". That's too bad, too,
since I liked watching it get pummeled by far more than just "3500 Unique
Visitors". Would love to download the raw data on this one. Wonder who gave me
these pings of love...

**Note:** *Typical users will have javascript enabled in their browsers. The
Google Analytics side reveals that the 3500 requests shown by cloudflare were
just bare requests, no js executed or cookies- Nothing. Just someone saying
"hello". Interesting, nonetheless.*
