title: Work Again- Finally
---

It feels good to be working again. I've missed having a place to go every day.
I've missed being tired after putting in a genuine effort for eight hours,
turning in and being able to pass out from exhaustion. When you're sitting
around all day, you don't really get tired from anything other than the passage
of time. It simply doesn't feel half as satisfying as being tired from the
expense of energy and the pleasure of having been productive.

This job has to be the most exhausting job I've ever been tasked with. I'm
currently operating a robotic arm that loads a CNC lathe with aluminium tubes,
which also unloads and drops the finished pieces onto a conveyor. It's pretty
complex for a one-man operation. The robot is testy, as well as the conveyor
rig. It seems like there may even be an excess of sensors for the operation.
Some of the hangups I encounter on a daily basis seem damn near excessive. I
can't complain, though. It's something to do.

On another note, it would seem the internet access to the house has been knocked
into the "basic service" level. I think it's pulling about 50 kbps. This is
incredibly unacceptable. I think I'm going to have to notch that up some, at
least if I'm to keep sane. There are over eight devices sharing one wireless
router, connected to this terribly slow service. Maybe 8 mbps is a possibility.
We'll see how my overtime pans out.

Well, I need to get out of here. Shit to do, and all. I have purpose again.
