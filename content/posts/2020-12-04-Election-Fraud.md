Donald Trump is completely correct; There absolutely is a widespread and concerted effort to kick his ass out of the White House. Myself and 80 million other voters conspired to vote for Biden and ensure that orange bag of dicks is out on his ass January 21st, 2021. As far as "Election Fraud", it's not necessary when you've allowed a quarter million Americans to just die, all while downplaying the virus. The only fraud is Trump pretending he's even remotely capable of acting as a sitting president. We've seen fifty cases now get shot down. He's brought fifty court cases forward in various states challenging election results, and zero real victories resulted. Now he's crying that he's going to veto defense funding because Twitter made him so pissy.
While we're on the subject; Fuck Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell as well. They're worthless trash.
