Just a couple things. First of all, I may have work lined up soon. Woo! Big
hurdle crossed with that one, a lot of time and effort finally paying off. It's
only been a year since I've last had gainful employment. Here's hoping I'm
employed soon and from here on. Second, I've dumped my contracted cellular
provider in favor of one of those cheap services that are typically associated
with "burners". It's going to get me through the hard times, that's all that
really counts. I need a phone. I won't have to go without. Lastly, if I get a
job soon you shouldn't expect my blog updates to be as rapidfire as they are
now. Life is hectic enough without a job, it's going to be far more so when I'm
working again. I probably won't want to touch this damn blog, despite the
satisfaction I get from updating it. It's quite possible that I'll have the time
but not the inclination. You never know.

Lastly, I can say I've seen a lot of drama lately. I'm sitting on the sidelines
because drama is pointless. I just sit back and watch it, with a bucket of
popcorn, not wanting any part of it myself. I don't get why people want to make
each other miserable. Usually the ones inflicting upon the others are sorely
lacking any direction in life. Get a job. Get a hobby. Be a productive member of
society. No one cares what you have to hold over someone else's head. Grow up.
What's pathetic is that you'll see drama coming from twenty-somethings, but vast
volumes of it come from the 30 or 40+ crowd. Take your grandchildren to a movie.
Stop shitting on each other, Christ. Thanks for teaching me that wisdom does not
necessarily come with age.

Well, that's it for today's rant. Don't expect a whole lot in the near future. I
might disappear even more completely than I had already.
