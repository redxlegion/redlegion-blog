title: Kramdown and Common Sense
---

Boy did I herp before I derped. All this time I could've been posting
thumbnailed images, but I didn't peek into the specifics of [Kramdown][1] or how
to do it. Ruby seems to be a literal octopus of a language, with all these
parsers and things. Ruby seems to be the new Visual Basic, reinventing spaghetti
mess. At least it produces pretty results, though.

Simple tip, excellent results, not sure why I didn't think to experiment with it
in the first place. Maybe because my initial impression of Kramdown was that
it's kinda touchy. Don't know. In any case, I'm a fan now. I might use Kramdown
more often, for more than just this blog. Who knows.
