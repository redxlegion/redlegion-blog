title: What the Hell
---

This is really just a sort of a quick blurb about how I still exist. Nothing really else to say at the moment. Not sure when I'll update again or what my update will consist of. I'm strongly considering gutting this space for something else. Not sure what. There are a few things I'll continue to host in perpetuity, though. At least, I fully intend to host until the statute of limitations is long past. Fucking lame skids.

I'm sure that when I get a minute I'm also going to wax poetic about life in general and about successes, lessons learned, things I'm striving for, and the happinesses in my life. I just can't make any promises at the moment.

This is turning into a more long-winded update than I had originally intended. That's okay I guess.

Anyways, you can watch this space or not. Regardless of what you do or even regardless of the upcoming net neutrality bullshit, I'm not going to be silenced. Not permanently. I might post infrequently, but my voice will always be heard.

Peace, bitches.

_**Addendum:** I think I know what I'll blog about next, as far as tech material. I'll toss up my current irssi setup in it's entirety, using AWL and a few other scripts._
