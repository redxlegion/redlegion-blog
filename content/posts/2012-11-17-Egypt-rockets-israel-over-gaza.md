[Egypt Urges Push for Gaza Peace as Rockets Hit Israel][story] via
[Businessweek][bus]

This is something I've felt strongly about for some time. I've been
irritated that people seem to believe zionism is some God-given right to
the jewish people. Bullshit. They have no more right to that land than
early American settlers had to the plots they "purchased" from Native
Americans for handfulls of beads.

Get over yourselves, you zionism peddling fascists. If anything, the
holocaust was only brought about because fascists know their own. I
realize how brutal of an assertion that is, but I stand by what I say.

Here, I have an idea. Educate yourself so you can develop an informed
opinion. It doesn't necessarily have to reflect my own, so long as you
get a decent helping of information on both sides of the conflict.
