Slowly but surely, I'm realizing that I'm important. I deserve to be happy. I
deserve to have people in my life that care. I'm above begging for responses.
I'm above begging for human decency. I'm above begging for clarity. I'm above
begging for kindness and compassion. People that can't offer those bare minimums
can absolutely get the fuck out of my life and stay the fuck out of my life,
they aren't deserving of my time or attention. I already have so many people in
my life that don't make me beg for the bare minimums, but give me those bare
minimums just because I'm worth being cared about. I care just as much about
them, and for the first time in a long time I'm beginning to understand healthy
relationships. This new year is going to be the best year, I'm going to do
everything I can to ensure that it will be. I'm going to make the best life I
can for myself, for my kids, and for my friends and family. I am loved, and I
started with loving myself.  

For the next couple years I'm going to focus real hard on my career. I'm being
given so many opportunities to exponentially propel myself not only into a
spotlight, but into history books. And dammit, I'm not letting the opportunity
pass me by. I'm going to make the absolute best of my life, because I deserve
nothing less. My kids deserve nothing less. 2020 is going to be my year.
