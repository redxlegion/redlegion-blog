Now I have an even greater stake in how personal the election is to me. Whatever the long-term effects are of COVID, I'm going to be saddled with that shit. In the interim, it's a horrible disease to have. I frequently cough to the point of nearly vomiting, the fever and chills are horrendous, and the body aches are otherworldly.

Donald J. Trump should be tried in a military tribunal for treason. He has aided foreign nations and ignored the safety of Americans. We should seek the penalty of death by hanging. This has to happen- Now. Donald Trump deserves to hang for what he has done with the office of President. What he continues to do, undermining our election, dividing the country. Trump does not deserve to walk away from his presidency with his life intact. Period.
