I've been watching **The Alt Right**, _Boogaloo Boys_, and other undesirables' activity online. I've been at it for some time now. In all reality, I've probably consumed more of material than they do. I don't monitor them because I care about them, agree with them, or enjoy their ideas. On the contrary, I find them to be utterly repulsive as people. They strike me as being lesser creatures, if I'm being completely honest. But I find it important that someone keep an ear to the ground on their trends. My reasoning here [is not without merit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/29/whitmer-kidnapping-plot-man-charged-threatened-trump-obama-online/6067348002/). I've surveilled numerous Telegram extremist channels for over a year now, and I'm considering busting out Evernote and compiling everything I've seen so far in either a single long blog post or multiple blog posts spanned over the course of a few months. I intend to dig up what I can about where these people come from, what their occupations are, and possible root causes behind why they are the way they are. I know that I'll answer maybe one of those questions or none of them, but I feel like I should at least make the attempt to document what's out there and how easy it is to find yourself in the midst of American extremists. I think it'll prove to be interesting and hopefully informative.

I've been kicking the idea around for some time, but I've typically been incredibly behind on maintaining this blog. I feel as though I've finally caught up after having migrated from Jekyll to Hugo and settling all the details of the configuration and importing of material. It may be time to finally start working through some OSINT, gathering data, and possibly doing some rather mild digital undercover work.

One thing is for sure, don't expect a miracle any time soon. I'll absolutely intersperse bullshit posts like this one as filler material and any palpable content is guaranteed to be months out, if not more. Just getting started gathering information and making it into something cohesive will be a feat on it's own.
