title: Oh, the Hubris!

So, it looks like the battle rages on between
[Emick](https://twitter.com/#!/AsherahResearch) and
[Hubris](https://twitter.com/#!/backtracesec). Will the rampant Googler win, or
the drug-addled vet? Only time will tell, and now YOU can witness the
rofl-tastic dissolution of the mighty [Backtrace Security](http://www.backtracesecurity.com/).

I've preserved some timelines for posterity.

Have fun, kids. Don't get hurt Googling yourselves. :3
