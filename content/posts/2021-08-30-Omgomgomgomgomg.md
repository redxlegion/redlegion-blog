It keeps creeping closer and closer. Minute by minute. Day by day. It's almost here and I'm insanely excited. I'm building a life with an amazing partner and we're doing amazing things together. The excitement is really starting to well up and I can't avoid just popping off anymore. I can't wait. There are so many awesome things we're planning and it's going to be so much fun. I'm gonna network the shit out of the house with _**smart everything**_. It's gonna be awesome.

I'm just so grateful to have someone in my life that's so wonderful and amazing and wants to work with me to accomplish things and for us to be awesome together. I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
