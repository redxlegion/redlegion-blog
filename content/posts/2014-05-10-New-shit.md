I've added a few new things to the blog. Nothing special. I've begun
[linking to blogs that link to me][1]. I've also added a [shortcut to
howto/informational posts][2]. I'm thinking this blog might start
turning into an "Engineering"-heavy mess pretty soon. I've taken an
introduction to GD&T recently. The spiral into Hell has whipped into a
tailspin already.
