Just writing this to keep up appearances. I don't really have anything new or
interesting to add. I suppose the Trayvon Martin saga will be interesting to
watch as it unfolds, I just hope people don't treat the expert analysis like a
fucking referee making a call. If an expert makes a determination, just go with
it. Don't yell and scream that the determination is wrong just because you don't
agree with the end result. That's what retards do. Instead, learn to accept
reality for what it is, rather than sticking your head in the sand whenever
something becomes uncomfortable.

I've been damned busy lately. Lots of working, blogging, spending time with
people, doing things I have to get done. It seems like the task list is never
ending. At least I have approximately five minutes of down time each day to just
waste on 4chan or other retarded nonsense (like following infosec "pros" on
twitter).

Well, I'm going to leave you with something I found [absolutely
hilarious](/img/2012/ductspoon.png).
