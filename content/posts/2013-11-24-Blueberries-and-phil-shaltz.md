title: Blueberries and Phil Shaltz
---

Twitter harbors some interesting people. Far more interesting people
than most social networks such as Myspace and Facebook, perhaps in part
because it's not as popular as the aforementioned social networks.
Individuals such as [C1TYofFL1NT](https://twitter.com/C1TYofFL1NT) and
[TheLastBand1t](https://twitter.com/TheLastBand1t) are quite attentive
to some fascinating goings-on in Flint. They're more attentive to local
politics than any other folks I've met.

Specifically, these two gentlemen are keen on blueberries. What does
anything important have to do with blueberries? The answer probably
won't surprise you, because your gut instinct is quite correct when you
assume __nothing at all__. That's right, Phil Shaltz bought a billboard
and had it say "I'm concerned about the blueberries."

What about blueberries? It's distraction. Pure and simple, Phil bought a
billboard to give the media something to report on. I'm sure the
billboard was a good deal cheaper than how much it costs to
"micro-manage" local media. And why not? Phil pretty much owns the flint
emergency manager.

The corruption runs deep, too. <del>Phil administers something called
the "NERD fund", a supposed non-profit whose donors are protected from
public scrutiny.</del> Governor Snyder began the controversial "NERD
fund", in which it's no stretch to imagine Shaltz has ties to Snyder. It
has apparently raised some $1.5 million. Phil has effectively invested
in owning the Flint Emergency Manager as well as the Detroit Emergency
manager. It gets even better when you realize that the Flint Emergency
Manager appointed an infamous Detroit police officer as Flint's Chief of
Police. Who was appointed? The very officer accused of obstructing the
investigation of Kwame Kilpatrick for the murder of Tamara Greene.

Blueberries, Phil? You can suck my blueberries, pal.
