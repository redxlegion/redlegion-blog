I never wanted to get into politics, I've enjoyed abstaining for a
long time. It had only become complicated when pieces of legislation
like the Digital Millenium Copyright Act managed to sluice through the
cracks and fuck up my life. Yes, this act directly effects me. Yes,
it's detrimental to my lifestyle. It's detrimental to my data
aggregation habits.

In any case, I'm voting for Bernie for some pretty damned decent
reasons. He's totally opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership; a
horror-show of 7,000 pages dedicated to NAFTA-esque freebies for
exporting U.S. jobs. Bernie also supports net neutrality. Why would he
support net neutrality, you ask? Nearly all the momentum that has
propelled him in this election originated from free and democratic
access to the internet. The idea that I should have to pay extra to
AT&T or Comcast for people to access my Twitter feed at a reasonable
speed is not only asinine, it's unconstitutional.

I voted for Bernie in Michigan's primary. I'm going to vote for him
again in the general election, he's going to be on the ballot. Hillary
is a disgusting creature and quite possibly won't even be eligible for
the democratic nominee spot.

I encourage everyone to read Hillary's emails on Wikileaks.
