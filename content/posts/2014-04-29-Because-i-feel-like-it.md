Sometimes I just feel like [bragging][1]. Other times I feel like
[yelling from a mountain][2]. Sometimes I just want to be [silly][3]
about it.

No matter what, it's inescapable. I'm in love. I'm at the mercy of my
love and willfully so. I am in love, have created life, and a [loving
family][4].

My life is nearly complete. All I have to do now is spend it helping
complete the lives of those I love.
