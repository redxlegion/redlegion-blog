I think I'm a little in shock about how much work I have coming my way. It's pretty intense. It looks like I'm going to have at least two, possibly three concurrent high profile projects as well as a number of smaller projects interspersed. I can't really say how things are going to go, but I'm going to do my damnedest to get it done and do it right.
I'm also writing this post on my phone using JuiceSSH, which is pretty cool. I'm glad I bought it. It works really well. It has this badass feature that allows you to use the virtual keyboard as either a "hunt and peck" for commands or an "autocorrect" for long strings of English words.
I'm also tunneled into a raspberry pi over WireGuard. I need to buy at least one more of those, maybe two, and a large external drive to tether to it.
Well, back to the grind, I guess.
