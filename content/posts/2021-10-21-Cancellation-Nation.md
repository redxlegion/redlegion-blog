Words are not violence. I don't care how hard you cry about words or how much
you believe the words hurt you, words are not capable of inflicting physical
damage upon a person. To that end, I have to say that I don't support the war on
words.

Dave Chappelle is a great example of society's "War on Words".

> Terf,”

First of all, the word "transphobic" is a non-issue. I'm sorry, but that's just
the way it is. If you want me to pile onto criticizing someone, telling me I
need to do it because they're any kind of *-phobic isn't going to garner much
from me other than just walking away from you as you continue talking.
Individuals all have formed opinions and ideas and no two are alike.

Second of all, Dave Chappelle never at any point advocated for violence or
cruelty towards trans individuals. He simply stated that he's siding with
trans-exclusionary radical feminists on a hot-button issue that still isn't
"settled" in any capacity. Contrary to trans wishes, TERFs have every right to
exist. Telling them they have no right to exist proves even further that there
is a disconnect between the trans community and the feminist community.

Lastly, this is a great way to destroy your momentum. People are tired of
hearing "everything is transphobic" and "the boy who cried wolf" is really
starting to jump the shark. Just stop. You can't get everyone you don't like
fired, and fuck you for trying. Just grow up and change what you consume when
you don't like something. Christ.

I'll be honest, I'm not even a huge Chappelle fan. I'm not anti-trans either.
Trans folk have every right to exist that cis folk do. Trans individuals should
live with the exact same rights and liberties that cis individuals enjoy. But
this in particular? Fuck you, you don't get special rights over arts or media.
