I'm thankful for my kids. They're awesome little people and I love them. I'm thankful for my family. I've both been blessed with family members I'm blood related to as well as dragging people into my inner circle. I'm grateful for Amber, because she's wonderful and amazing and literally the best. I'm grateful for my career. It has taken me down some really interesting roads in life. I get to be a professional geek. There are a lot of reasons that I've been grateful over the holidays, and I don't take things for granted. I just felt like I had to share these things as they're the things I'm thinking about.

I'm also grateful that I didn't have to call 911 while quarantined with COVID. The chills and body aches were absolutely otherworldly, but I didn't feel at any point as though my life were in jeopardy. Not everyone can say that comfortably, and there are some still who are no longer with us. I've personally known people that have spent time on ventilators just fighting for their lives. It's really pretty insane, and I guess it's even more insane that our federal government has downplayed this crisis so hard since the beginning.

There are just so many thoughts, so many things I'd like to say, and I'm just a feckless jumble of randomness.

Someone drop me a line when the mysterious monolith disappears from Romania and reappears in some other crazy place.
