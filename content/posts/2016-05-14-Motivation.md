title: Motivation
---

I’m having a hell of a time maintaining my motivation. I’m learning new things, I’m honing old skills and developing new ones, I’m restructuring my entire “professional” existence. I’m doing big things, small things, all the things.

I dunno, I’m just petering out. I’ve been working 60+ hours for a few weeks now, and I’m burned out quite severely. I need a beer and a day with zero obligations. I need to sleep more than six hours. I know all of what I need. I’m also painfully aware of how scarce my needs really are. Life doesn’t work that way. It’s not so simple.

Well, I better get back to what I was doing. I just needed to take a minute to do something for myself instead of for others. Even if only for a minute, I had to take it.

Crap.
