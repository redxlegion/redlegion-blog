---

I'm being worked like a dog. Things are getting so rough at work that I
had to sleep 18 hours to catch up. I feel better now than I have in a
very long time.

That said, I've also taken some important steps in my life to make me
feel empowered. I've cut bad rubbish out. I've needed to remove negative
influences from my life so that I might start in a positive direction
with my new life, doing what I need to do to ensure the success of
myself and my own.

The waves of relief that swept over me upon adding blocked numbers to my
phone are quite unreal. I feel whole for the first time in a long time.
No longer cut down by horrible negative people who have nothing but
bitterness to disperse, who don't have lives to live and live solely to
cut down others. I'm more than happy to simply remove myself from their
sights.

Hopefully I'll have a free moment soon to resume writing about things
that truly interest me, rather than idiotic drama whores. Hobbies,
interests, and wonderful people to share them with- those are the things
that matter in life.
