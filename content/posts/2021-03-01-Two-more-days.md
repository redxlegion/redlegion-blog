The next two days are going to drag by so slowly. I can feel it already. Time is slipping by at a snail's pace, almost maliciously, seemingly with the intention of driving me insane. _**Dammit**_.

I'm hoping that a week of digital detox will allow me more tolerance for my hobbies as well as my career. Staring at a screen all day is starting to make it difficult for me to engage in the type of learning I enjoy outside of work. I can't complain too badly, as my line of work is pretty well right up my alley. 

Man, I hate that every time I start writing something, I slowly begin to hate the entire piece I'm writing. It's weird to be frustrated at my own inability to focus. I dunno. Well, whatever, Wednesday is coming.
