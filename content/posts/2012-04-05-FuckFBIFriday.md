![Fuck the FBI Mate](/img/2012/sabu.jpg)

It would seem the volume of tweets containing the hash tag "#FuckFBIFriday" has
dwindled tremendously. Lets frame a few things up, just for perspective.

 - [Hector Monsegur Arrested][1] -> June 7th, 2011
 - [Fuck FBI Friday, 1st Ed. is Released][2] -> June 5th, 2011
 - [Every Following #FFF Likely Lead to an Arrest][3] -> ???
 - PROFIT!!!

Is it me, or is this hilarious? Leaderless organization is an oxymoron.
Democracy can't exist in any system, suffice to say this is fairly decent
evidence to support such a statement. If Sabu weren't a leader, he wouldn't have
been as valuable to the FBI.

Rule number one on the internet seems to be "Trust no one". Easy rule to
maintain, as pretty much everyone on the internet is irritating.

Well, I'm off to bed. Have more important business to tend to, like sleep.

*P.S. How much you want to bet [these asshats][4] are getting pummelled in the
ass in prison right now?*
