title: He Hath Arrived
---

On March 28th my little man decided "enough is enough", and broke his mom's
water. He kicked the plug from the drain and started the wondrous process
of "labor".

Holy crap.

If he ever gives his mom crap about "I don't want to" or "I don't feel like
it", I'll be the first to stick up for her and say "You know, son, she went
through a lot of crap just to bring you into the world. The least you can
do is appease your mother. You owe her more than you will ever imagine."

He made his grand appearance on March 30th, 2013. He was 7 pounds, 10
ounces. He measured at 20 inches... I watched the whole thing and am still
not entirely sure what I witnessed. The doctors must've had it in for my
Panda, because they played the most cruel prank I've ever seen. They
started out with an even, heavy flow of hard narcotic for the initial
labor. From what I could see it was about 10mg/sec of Fentanyl. I suppose
it was administered intravenously to the interstitial portion of her spinal
cord. Once she was at the point of no return and had to deliver him
vaginally, they turned the epidural down to half. She started to feel
*everything*. She was not a happy camper, experiencing insane amounts of
pain and not sure at all she could follow through with what was about to
happen. He was pushed out, beautiful and brand-spanking new.

Since the 30th, I've been quite busy. I don't expect that to change for at
least another 18 years. Pictures will follow. Just give me time.
