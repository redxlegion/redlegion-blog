There are times when I can barely believe what my life is like. I have a partner who is my best friend and sexy as hell. I have wonderful kids. I have a career. I have everything I could wish for. I need to take time out to explain how appreciative I am for the privileges I am gifted. I've never had a love like this before, and I'll never have another love like it. It's important to me because it's an immense source of my life satisfaction, and it's only so satisfying because I was already happy before we met. The ability to take happiness and compound it the way my Amber has, I just never imagined getting to experience a true love that's based on communication and boundaries and a real and working healthy relationship.

This is what I want for the rest of my life.
