Jekyll 3 is something new entirely. My original template didn't play
nice. Completely lost my nav bar in the header and in the footer. That
was no bueno. I've since adapted to just using a '\_data/' block to
contain my navbar YAML. I guess that'll work, though I suspect my
install may be broken. No help was offered by \#jekyll just yet. We'll
see if maybe I can get some info from them.

I've also upgraded my FreeBSD machine to 10.2! WOO! That's been
overdue for a very long time. I'm using it currently to rsync this
feces to my remote cache of bullshit and garbage known as this blag.

Well, I don't really have anything genuine to offer at the moment, but
hopefully I'll get a second to concentrate at least a little effort
into documenting things I find fun. Maybe. We'll see.

Actually, this blog is aging very poorly. I haven't had any time at
all to contribute worthwhile things to it. That honestly depresses the
hell out of me. Maybe I'll whip something up that's helpful and work
related, or just hobby related. Maybe.

Big fucking maybe.

Oh well.

Oh yeah! One last thing...
