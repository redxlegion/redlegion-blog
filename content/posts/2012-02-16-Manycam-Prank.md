title: Manycam Prank
---

I used to run Wordpress a while back, and on that Wordpress blog I posted one of
the funniest Manycam pranks I've ever seen. Surprisingly, I was the one who did
this. I had a habit of using 1-guy-1-jar for my pranks, and I'm pretty sure
that's what I was showing this guy. Epic stuff. Without further ado, my foray
into making hate to people's eyes (aside from wearing skimpy swimwear).

*Note: Upon further inspection, I might've been using "BME Pain Olympics" or
some similar content to horrify this poor guy.*

By the way; Macbooks suck for Manycam pranks (and pretty much all other
computing tasks). Just wanted to get that off my chest, as I was on a Macbook
when I pulled this prank.
