title: Musings on Information Security
---

I've been thinking a lot lately about the "PsyOPS" and "InfoSec" professionals
that are wildly chasing hackers all over the internet. People claim they're so
elite because they're infiltrating **A GROUP THAT ANYONE CAN JOIN, REGARDLESS OF
RACE, CREED, OR RELIGION.** I guess it's tacitly not infiltration, as I'm sure
some of the "legit" members don't have the group's best interest at heart, for
various reasons. So if you're claiming to be "Destroyer of Anonymous", you fail
at life. You're a fucking loser- an asshat. The reality is that Anonymous is
destroying itself. It swells and declines. It will always eliminate parts of
itself. Kind of like pruning. No group with such radical and diverse beliefs can
remain cohesive. However, all "#prosec" douchebags are typically Republican,
Bradley Manning hating government suckups who shit on the first amendment and
would love to see all Arab Americans die. These are not generalizations- these
fucking nutbags still have sore tits over 9/11. At least, the "twitter vocal"
ones are that way. It's ironic. If you want to gain support for your cause of
"hating Anonymous", wouldn't you be nicer than a nazi? My guess is "mudsplatter
/ hubris" is still on the #prosec side of the fence, hunting Anonymous down with
PsyOPS and trolling. However, he's playing good cop at the moment. The minds at
Backtrace Security likely discovered that being raging douches from all angles
doesn't get you very far. So riding high on the crest of ["namshub.pdf"][1] and
the fact that all their dox came from the fallout just before HBGary, they're
trying like Hell to prove they're actually worth something to the internet, and
not just screaming trolls.

No matter how you boil it- snitching to FBI under pressure like Sabu, or
willingly swinging on FBI nuts like Emick... Scum is scum. You can't be
pro-government without being pro-douche. On that same token, you can't swing
with Anonymous without being a militant extremist. I think everyone involved
needs to calm the fuck down and get a grip on reality. Both sides need to take
their lithium. Until then, fuck everyone. They're all acting horribly retarded,
and I'm going to watch everyone fuck each other from the sidelines, and laugh
hysterically at all the retards scrambling to recover. Meanwhile, someone out
there is actually contributing code or vulnerabilities to information security,
and they're not even tweeting... Go figure.
