title: Return of the Asshat

The blog has been down a while. I know. I suck. I get that, I really do.
My computer took a shit. CPU fan died. Those things are a bitch when
they're fixtured to the motherboard. I had to completely disassemble
this piece of shit. At least I made it worth my while. Installed a 120mm
radiator / water-block closed circuit water cooling system instead of a
shitty typical fan.

Then, of course, once I installed the stupid water cooling system my PSU
had to take a shit. Yep. Such luck. So I got a relatively inexpensive
Corsair modular power supply to replace my current dead piece of shit
with. Not bad. The worst part of the ordeal was all the time spent
buying the parts, assembling the shit, and jury rigging it every which
way.

But here I am. I'm back. I'm sure you don't care. I'm also fairly
certain the crowd concerned by my presence is nil.

Perhaps one of these days I'll get an opportunity to actually blog. That
would be cool.

_**EDIT:**_ Excuse No. 3011; Chunkhost is shit and they're no longer my
host of choice.
