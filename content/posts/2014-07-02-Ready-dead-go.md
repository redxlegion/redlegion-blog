I'm wearing down pretty quickly. Mandatory overtime isn't enjoyable.
It's coming at me steady and fast. I'm told I'll have help. I'm told
they'll hire another person. That extra help never comes. Nothing gets
easier. I just fall further behind. It's tiring. I'm bored with it. I'm
ready to move on to bigger and better things. I'm ready to get my life
moving in a direction I want it to move.

I haven't slept much in the last week. I'm pretty damned sick. I get
fuck all in time to unwind. My employer is whipping me relentlessly.

I don't know. I just need a break. I need to dive into a hobby and take
my mind off work, which really does not matter that much, and take my
mind off of the stresses of daily life.
