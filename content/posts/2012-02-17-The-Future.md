![Depression](/img/depression.jpg "Depression")

I really don't think people understand how things are going to play out now that
we're reaching and breaching the "Recession" portion of our downard spiral. It's
nearing "Depression", and it might last a lot longer than four years, or even
ten years. The last time this country entered a depression, it lasted ten years,
and only rebound because FDR signed "The New Deal". Social services to catch the
fallen masses were put into effect to guarantee that during times of hardship,
we would persist. I surmise that the next depression we're due for can last no
less than twenty years, being prolonged by the fact that we do have social
services to catch people who are downtrodden. Until the New Deal had been signed
and put into effect, we really had no idea what impact it would have on the long
run. Being that it was large and important, we can safely assume the effect will
be broad and far reaching. That said, this groundhog predicts a long line of
bone-chilling winters for many US families. Quite a few, I believe, won't live
through the coming disaster. How the government react, however, could very well
determine future economic catastrophies to come. I eagerly await their decision.
