It feels really weird to be back in the office. I've been working from home for a couple weeks now and I can't say I'm used to the structured corporate feel anymore. It was kind of a shock to come back to. I am, however, finally able to make some progress on the projects I've been assigned. It's not really possible to install automation equipment that weighs more than two cars in a two bedroom apartment, so I haven't been as productive as I'd prefer.

Now I'm back, and I'm ready to roll. _Let's git 'er done._
