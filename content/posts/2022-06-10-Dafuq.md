It's been a minute since I've pinged, so consider this my "ping". I don't know
necessarily that I have anything of any importance to say, but I figured I'd
should say something regardless of whether it's important or not.

I can't really think of anything of substance to really write about. I really
just wanted to let the world know I'm still alive, even though my posting is
becoming incredibly rare. I just don't have that much time to update and post
like I'd really prefer to. It's crazy, too, because I have my laptop. I have a
damn decent phone, even. There are so many avenues I could use to post
regularly, but truly- The only reason I don't is because I actually don't have
the time.

I'm pretty sure that I've had at least five great ideas for what to write about
on this damn thing since the last time I wrote a post. It's really frustrating,
because it feels like I should've just dedicated the time to do it when the
thought occurred to me instead of allowing it to pass me by. I guess it's really
a choice rather than a true limitation of time, but I don't really know how to
choose differently right now. Anyways. This is what you get. Sorry.
