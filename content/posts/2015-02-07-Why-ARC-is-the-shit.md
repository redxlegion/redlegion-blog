title: Why ARC is the Shit

Download [this][1]. Download it now. See below.

It's now seemingly within reach to run Android apps on nearly any
platform on which Chrome will run. All you need is a functioning flavor
of ARC (App Runtime for Chrome).

I've tested it on ChromeOS, and it works. The fastest way to get set up
is to download "twerk" at the link above, then grab any app that says
"Also for Android" (which will automagically grab ARC for you). After
that, grab your favorite APK [from play store][2] and convert it with
twerk. Tons of apps work. A few don't, but it nonetheless makes your
Chromebook way more functional. Not to mention is a cool way to dick
around with Android apps on any other platform.

Not sure why I'm so amused by this, but I most certainly am.

Google Lifehack for more info on grabbing modified versions of ARC.
