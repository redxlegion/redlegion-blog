title: Another Day
---

Today is a good day. Today is a new lease on life, a new start, a rebirth. Today
is the day I begin taking back my own destiny. I've found myself with a ton of
extra free time, and a friend of mine made a few suggestions that I think I'll
take. "Start prepping meals for the week. Start working out. Get a personal
trainer. Work on yourself." He's not wrong. I'm too old to neglect my health.
I'm not getting a personal trainer, that's beyond my financial reach at the
moment, but I have a fitness room I can access at my apartment complex. I can
eat healther, I'm already dropping weight. I'm going to take control of my
health, since I have time to take control of it. I'm also taking better care of
my living environment. I'm picking up extra hours at work. All the while, I'm
still able to treat my kids like the amazing little humans they are.  

It's up to me to make myself important. It's up to me, and I'm taking control of
my life for the best, for everyone I love. I'm going to make 2020 the best damn
year I can make it, and I'm not going to shy away from opportunities or
challenges. I'm going to meet them head on, and by God I'll conquer them all. I
am a strong person. I can do this. I will do this. I've been doing this. Today
isn't just another day. Today is a new day.
