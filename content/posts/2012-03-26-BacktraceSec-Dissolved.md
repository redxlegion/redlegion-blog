title: BacktraceSec Dissolved
---

It looks like [Hubris][1] has finally had enough. Enough of what, I can't tell.
But the fallout between Him and [A5h3r4h][4] has been *sincerely* lulzy. I'm damn
near dying, laughing at her condescending, [horrible "help" email][2], in which
she belittles and is generally bitchy, status quo. It looks like BacktraceSec
has been generating some funds in their witch-hunt of Anons, and A5h3r4h
(henceforth referred to in this post as "Emick"), can't seem to hold on to any
of it. Of course, with any e-drama leakage onto the internet, it's important to
take everything you read with a grain of salt. However, I'm still reading the
[fucking hilarious twitter fight][3]\* between them. A few things gleaned in the
past five minutes of reading:

* Emick is IT-illiterate and is ingrateful for Hubris' efforts.
* Emick is loudmouthed (already known by everyone in InfoSec).
* Hubris definitely has a drug problem.
* Hubris has more planned for the shitstorm- KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED.

This is going to be pretty fucking epic. See what happens when you try and
coalesce snitches into one tiny area? Shit hits the fan in the greatest of ways.

REDLEGION FOR SNITCH-CON 2013!

FUCK YEAH. LOL.

Lastly, everyone out there really ought to take my **grain of salt** comment
seriously. These people literally have no lives, they sit in front of Google all
day, hunting down people who do have lives. This reeks of retarded troll
bullshit, but you never know. All we can do is sit and watch them herp in their
own derp.
