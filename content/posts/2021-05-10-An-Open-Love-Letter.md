I am your "ride or die". I don't write that in any light-hearted way. It's a sentiment I intend to express in the most declamatory way possible. It isn't something to whisper, it's something to shout from the tallest building or emblazon a blimp with. 
I've always used words to cope with difficult situations in life. I can elaborate every detail of hardships and sadness and the words roll off my tongue effortlessly, as it's something I've done for a very long time. Less so when times have been easy, or during times of contentment. In fact, the happier I am the more tongue-tied I typically feel. That said, it's hard for me to write about life right now. It isn't that I don't have hardships to endure. I certainly do. Everyone does. The real difficulty for me stems from having such an immense surplus of positivity in my life. I'm buying a house with the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I've found someone who makes me feel intellectually, emotionally, and completely fulfilled. I'm going to marry this wonderful woman. Every hardship and difficult situation seems so minute and distant.
I should honestly try to write more regardless of how I'm feeling so that I might normalize writing in general, not just as a coping mechanism. I feel like it really limits the range of my expressiveness. I have the most amazing partner ever. I feel like it does her a great disservice for me to feel nearly "tongue-tied" because I'm happy.
I am your "ride or die" because I love you and appreciate you. You are beautiful and the embodiment of what humanity could be if love and patience were priorities. I am daily in awe of you. I feel as though I could spend a lifetime getting to know you and still be surprised by your combination of loving positivity and intelligence. I love you so very much. I also want to have sex with you 24/7. I'm just glad you chose me, and I hope you always do from here on out. I will always choose you. I love you.
