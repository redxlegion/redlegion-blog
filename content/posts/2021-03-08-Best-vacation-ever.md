Man, I have to say that Cancun is easily one of the coolest places to visit on the planet. The moment you land in the airport you smell floral green-ness everywhere. You're literally landing in the jungle. I need to post some pictures from the trip soon. I guess this is just a ping to make sure people know my plane didn't go down in the Yucatan jungle or anything like that. But I'll definitely be posting pictures ASAP.
