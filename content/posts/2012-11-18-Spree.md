title: Spree

In case you haven't noticed, I've been on a blogging spree since
reviving this dead space. I fully intend to continue my spree so long as
I'm able, even though it won't be as easy as it has in the past. Right
now I require physical access to my desktop machine in order to update,
whereas previously I could update from my desktop, phone, or any other
machine I deemed fit to remotely access my favorite machine.

I suppose I'm off to do other things for the moment. Once I'm in a
stable situation that I can have even the smallest amount of free time,
I'll be sure to bore the hell out of you with more blog posts. Until
then, if anyone reads this, they'll have to settle for the pittance of
garbage I'm currently spewing.
