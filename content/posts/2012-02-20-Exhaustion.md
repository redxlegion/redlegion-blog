I'm beginning to wonder if my name is on a blacklist somewhere, prohibiting me
from being considered by other companies for employment. It's starting to appear
that way, what with my increasing frequency of applying to jobs. I can't help
but wonder if I'm going to be forced into abject poverty by lack of employment,
as I'm already considering routes less traveled for income. Don't know. One
thing I do know is that a job is a precious thing in this current eonomic
climate, and I wholly have no intention of telling people online where I'm
working. I can't let anything jeopardize my income, should the day come where I
have income.
