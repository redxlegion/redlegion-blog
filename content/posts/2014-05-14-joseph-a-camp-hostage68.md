Attention to everyone who was harassed or threatened by Joseph Camp:

I just got word that his sentencing is Tuesday, and he's going to he
served 5 months and when he's out he's free to do as he pleases. I
myself don't believe this is someone who belongs in a normal functioning
society, therefore a few of us have started a campaign to get him some
sort of supervision when he is released. How can you help?
Simple....write to:

US Parole Officer George Martin
100 State St.
Rochester, NY 14614

or

you can reach him by phone at (585) 666-5901


and tell him about your encounter with this maniac. The last thing we
want is him around again harassing people for Sue Basko (don't worry,
disbar comin) again and invading people's lives and their privacy. This
is your chance to put a completely horrible human being away and
hopefully make him learn his lesson.
