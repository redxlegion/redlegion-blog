Judge Bruce Schroeder should absolutely be removed from his position. He's
clearly unfit for the bench. This son of a bitch has consistently demonstrated
that he has a bias toward murderer Rittenhouse with his ridiculous behavior. You
know it's bad when a prosecutor is advising that a judge is acting outside the
law. No, judges are not 'the law', they're supposed to interpret it. However,
there are always instances where the law is clear, and even someone without a
position of power can interpret it. This boomer piece of shit is trying to get
Rittenhouse off.

we have Schroeder lamenting that Kyle could serve time.

What a fucking piece of shit. I hope this boomer trash dies of COVID. He
deserves it.
